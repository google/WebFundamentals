There are a few keyboard shortcuts when dealing with the debugger. A few are:

<ul>
<li>Toggle a breakpoint while on a line: Cmd + B</li>
<li>Select the next call frame: Ctrl + .</li>
<li>Select the previous call frame: Ctrl + ,</li>
</ul>

Also, you may notice from a few Dev Tips ago (<a href="https://umaar.com/dev-tips/21-highlight-paused-statement/">21. highlight paused statement</a>) that when you navigate through the call stack, the exact column is highlighted.
