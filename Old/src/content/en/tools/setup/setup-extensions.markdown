<p class="intro">
  Out of the box, every desktop browser comes with a set of developer tools, you can extend and add to these with extensions or plugins for your browser.
</p>

Here are two Chrome Extensions that have some useful functionality to help with
debugging your designs.

## Emmet Re:View

Emmet Re:View is a tool which makes it easy to see what your site looks like at
each of your media queries and syncs the scrolling of all the pages. You can see
a demo of it [on their
site](http://re-view.emmet.io/).

## What Font?

The last extension we use on a regular basis is *What Font?*. This Chrome Extension
will tell you the name of the font currently being used on the page. This is
really handy for debugging any web font issues.
