Translations
============

All article sources are in `src/content`. The base content is in English under the "en" directory. Add translations by following the same structure with either a two letter or composite language code: e.g. "es", "pt-br".

Update the build to include the language code in the `langs_available` variable in config/common.yml. For example, to add French:
```
    langs_available: ["fr"]
```

Adding a translation
--------------------

1.  Find the article in the original source language
2.  Create the root language code in `src/content` if it does not exist for the language you
    are translating.  For example create `src/content/es` for Spanish.
3.  Create the article in the same directory hierarchy but under this new directory.
4.  Translate the article
5.  Translate the article YAML metadata
	1.  Localize the title
	2.  Localize the description
	3.  Localize the introduction
	4.  Localize the notes (if present)
	5.  Localize the key-takeaways (the TLDR's if present).
6.  Give yourself some credit by adding your details to the contributors file and add your
    name to the "translators:" property.
