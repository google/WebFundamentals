Translations
============

The base content is in english under the "_en" directory. Translations can be added following the same structure with either a two letter or composite language code: e.g. "_es", "_pt-br".

To test translations set the lang variable in the _config.yml. For example, to set the mode to French:

    lang: "fr"

Note the underscore is not required here.

To ensure the content is built when being released onto developers.google.com, ensure that the langs_available list in _config-devsite.yml is updated to include any new language directories being added. For example, to add French:

    langs_available: ["fr"]


Adding a translation
--------------------

1.  Find the article in the original source language
2.  Create the root language code in `src/site` if it does not exist for the language you
    are translating.  For example create `src/site/_es` for Spanish.
3.  Create the article in the same directory hierarchy but under this new directory.
4.  Translate the article
5.  Translate the article YAML metadata
	1.  Localize the title
	2.  Localize the description
	3.  Localize the introduction
	4.  Localize the notes (if present)
	5.  Localize the key-takeaways (the TLDR's if present).
6.  Give yourself some credit by adding your details to the contributors file and add your
    name to the "translators:" property.
