key-takeaways:
  navigation-drawer:
    - Your Navigation Drawer should be easily accessible to the user.
    - If the number of sections is too large, consider grouping the items and expanding / contracting the groups. Avoid overwhelming your users.
    - Don't hide key actions inside the drawer. Actions like search should be prominently on the home page, not hidden in the drawer.

The Navigation Drawer is a slide in panel which is primarily used for displaying a sites navigation, but can also be used for displaying global state, i.e. user login.

A user accesses the drawer using a menu button at the top of the screen in the App Bar.

{% include modules/takeaway.liquid list=page.key-takeaways.navigation-drawer %}

The key advantages of this approach is that the content can grow inside a scrolling element, allowing for larger site structures and it takes up a very small amount of screen real estate.

For users there is a small amount to learning to do to find the Navigation Drawer so having a clearly place menu button is extremely important.

### Tabs vs Navigation Drawer

Some developers find they get higher rates of interaction when using a tab bar instead of a Navigation Drawer.

The choice is a trade off between the flexibility of the Navigation Drawer with the visibility of a Tab Bar which you should consider what is best suited to your site.
