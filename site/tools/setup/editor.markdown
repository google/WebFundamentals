## Truly learn to use your editor

Code editors are the quintessential development tool.
But what makes an editor more than a simple word processor
are its shortcuts that get you working faster.

You know you've truly learned to use your editor
when you are able to quickly move around your code
using a range of keyboard short-cuts and editor commands.
It's always good to keep a cheatsheet handy for editor commands.
Top editors also let you customize commands and keyboard shortcuts
so that you only have to remember your own implementations.

<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> is a great editor with tons
of plugins to help you write better code faster. It also has a package manager
that makes it easy to install new plugins. Though Sublime costs money, you can
try it for free and this guide assumes Sublime as the default editor of
choice.

## Install the package manager

Package managers make it easy to find, install, and keep packages / plugins up-to-date.

Here's a sneak peak at what you can do with the
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">Sublime Text package manager</a>.

## There's a plugin for that

Plugins help you stay more productive.
What are the things you keep having to
go back out to other tools to do?

Linting - there's a plugin for that.
Showing what changes haven't been committed - 
there are plugins for that.
Integration with other tools,
such as GitHub,
there are plugins for that.

Package managers make it very easy to find, install, and update plugins.
In the Sublime editor,
open your package manager
(`ctrl+shift+p`),
enter 'Install Package', and
then enter the name of the plugin you are looking for
(or else browse all plugins).

Check out these
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/browse">trending lists of Sublime plugins</a>.
Here are the plugins we love and recommend you install because they help you speed up your development:
