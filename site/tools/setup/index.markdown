A good development environment sets you up for success.  

A great editor lets you code efficiently and helps you identify issues quickly; Developers tools that integrate into the browser let you quickly check that the code you create produces the correct output across all browsers; and a bootstrapper lets you start your project that follows all the best practices in seconds.
