Web developers have to think about a million things at once and the build step
is one of the most critical, yet most cumbersome to get started with.  You
have to work out all the tasks that you need to automate such as: Image
compression, CSS minification, JavaScript concatenation, Responsive testing,
Unit testing, the list goes on...

Follow these guides and learn the best way to structure your workflow so that
the sites that you create already follow all the best practices from the
minute you start.

You can also use Web Starter Kit to begin your projects with an amazing
default workflow and great looking templates right out of the box.
