introduction: "Forms are hard to fill out on mobile. The best forms are the ones with the
fewest inputs. Good forms provide semantic input types. Keys should change to
match the user's input type; users pick a date in a calendar. Keep your user
informed. Validation tools should tell the user what they need to do before
submitting the form."
