Web Fundamentals
================

Web Fundamentals is a technical documentation center for multi-device web 
development.  Our goal is to build a resource for modern web developers 
that’s as curated and thorough as developer.android.com or iOS Dev Center.

In this repo (which is the fork of  google/WebFundamentals) we are going to focus on a hebrew translation for WF.
Please feel free to ping me and join this effort.



Content plan
------------
Content plan for Web Fundamentals is tracked through GitHub Issues and our [Site Structure + Content Inventory](http://goo.gl/nWDD0M) doc


Release status
--------------

The project was soft launched in late April with a formal v1 launch in June 2014.  We've now moved to a six-week rolling release cycle.

Technology
----------

This is a Jekyll build.

```
/src
  /appengine - the server to host the static content
  /site - the documentation
    /_en/ - the base language folder
      /getting-started - the getting started articles
      /multi-device-layouts - responsive design guide
      /introduction-to-media - the guide to using media
      /optimizing-performance - the perf articles
      /using-touch - managing touch
      /showcase - the case-studies
    /_langcode/ - overrides for that language, following the main path structure.
```

`/build` is never checked in but generated by Jekyll.

Installing Dependencies
=======================

Mac

1. Install [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
1. Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rubies/default)
    * `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`
1. Set RVM Default to 2.0.0
    * `rvm install ruby-2.0.0-p451`
    * `rvm --default use 2.0.0`
1. Install [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
    * `easy_install pygments`
1. Install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) dependencies ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)) 
    * cd src/ && `bundle install`
1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
1. Install the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/)
    * `npm install -g grunt-cli`

Running the site
================

Once you have all the dependencies installed go to the root of the checked out repo and type:

```
make server
```

This will have Jekyll build the site, run a static server to listen on port 8081 (which you can now reach at [http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals/](http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals/)), and watch for changes to site files. Every change will cause Jekyll to rebuild the affected files.


Using project-level meta data
=============================

The table of contents is generated from `src/site/_project.yaml`

To parse the `_project.yaml` file, include `{% injectdata content _project.yaml %}` in the page. You then have access to the variables in the page object.


Generating Table of Contents
----------------------------

The table of contents is generated from `src/site/_book.yaml`

To parse the `_book.yaml` file, include `{% injectdata content _book.yaml %}` in the page and then iterate as follows:

     {% for section in page.content.toc %}
        SOME MARKUP
     {% endfor %}

Jekyll Special elements
-----------------------

* Code import: `{% highlight javascript %} {% include sample1.js %} {% endhighlight %}`
* `{{ articles _category_}}` a list of articles in divs, ordered by the "order" preamble.
* `{{ showcases _category_}}` a list of showcases.


Translations
=============================

The base content is in english under the "_en" directory. Translations can be added following the same structure with either a two letter or composite language code: e.g. "_es", "_pt-br". 

To test translations set the lang variabe in the _config.yml. For example, to set the mode to French:

    lang: "fr"

Note the underscore is not required here. 

To ensure the content is built when being released onto developers.google.com, ensure that the langs_available list in _config-devsite.yml is updated to include any new language directories being added. For example, to add French:

    langs_available: ["fr"]
