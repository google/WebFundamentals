# Web Fundamentals <master> [![Build Status](https://ci.cloudware.io/api/badges/google/WebFundamentals/status.svg)](https://ci.cloudware.io/google/WebFundamentals)

`master` staging: https://web-central.appspot.com/web/
<hr>

Web Fundamentals is a technical documentation center for multi-device web
development.  Our goal is to build a resource for modern web developers
thatâ€™s as curated and thorough as developer.android.com or iOS Dev Center.

# Running the site

To run the site:

    gulp

This will compile styles & javascript and build the site with Jekyll. If thats
all working, it will start a server on port 7331 (which you can reach at
[http://localhost:7331/web/](http://localhost:7331/web/)).


Any changes to files will result in the appropriate tasks be running in gulp.

## Faster Jekyll Builds

To make the build faster you can define a language and/or section of the site
be built.

If you want to build a single language then run this:

    gulp --lang en

If you want to build a specific section then run this:

    gulp --section shows

These can be combined like so:

    gulp --lang en --section shows

## Learning More About Jekyll and Liquid Used

We have a resource area which you can access at [https://web-central.appspot.com/web/resources/?hl=en](https://web-central.appspot.com/web/resources/?hl=en) that should get you up and running with a lot of the custom and useful info.

# View staged pull requests and branches

**Note: this feature is experimental.**

The build process automatically creates staging sites for all pull requests.

To access the staging site for a pull request:

1. Open the pull request on `github.com`.
2. Click **Show All Checks**.
3. Click **Details** next to the **Builder** check. The staging site opens
   up in a new tab. 

You can also access each staging site directly, using the following URL:

    https://pr-<NUMBER>-dot-weasel-dot-web-central.appspot.com

Where `<NUMBER>` is the pull request number. For example, the URL for
PR #1000 would be:

    https://pr-1000-dot-weasel-dot-web-central.appspot.com

Staged branches are also available at:

    <branch>-dot-weasel-dot-web-central.appspot.com

Where `<branch>` is the name of the branch. 

**The URL pattern for pull requests and branches may change without notice.**
