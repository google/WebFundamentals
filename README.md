Web Fundamentals
================

Web Fundamentals is a technical documentation center for multi-device web
development.  Our goal is to build a resource for modern web developers
thatâ€™s as curated and thorough as developer.android.com or iOS Dev Center.

Content plan
------------
Content plan for Web Fundamentals is tracked through GitHub Issues and our [Site Structure + Content Inventory](http://goo.gl/nWDD0M) doc


Release status
--------------

The project was soft launched in late April with a formal v1 launch in June 2014.  We've now moved to a six-week rolling release cycle.

Technology
----------

This is a Jekyll build.

```
/appengine - the server to host the static content
/src - the documentation
  /_langs - the content in each language
    /en - the base language folder
      /getting-started - the getting started articles
      /multi-device-layouts - responsive design guide
      /introduction-to-media - the guide to using media
      /optimizing-performance - the perf articles
      /using-touch - managing touch
      /showcase - the case-studies
      ...etc...
    /<langcode> - overrides for that language, following the main path structure.
```

`/build` is never checked in but generated by Jekyll.

Running the site
================

Once you have all the dependencies installed go to the root of the checked out repo and type:

```
make server
```

This will have Jekyll build the site, run a static server to listen on port 8081 (which you can now reach at [http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals/](http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals/)), and watch for changes to site files. Every change will cause Jekyll to rebuild the affected files.

On Mac, due to the number of files in the project, you will likely need to increase the maximum number of open file handles.  Use `ulimit -n 1024` to increase the maximum number of open files to 1024 from the default of 256. 


Using project-level meta data
=============================

The table of contents is generated from `src/_project.yaml`

To parse the `_project.yaml` file, include `{% injectdata content _project.yaml %}` in the page. You then have access to the variables in the page object.


Generating Table of Contents
----------------------------

The table of contents is generated from `src/_book.yaml`

To parse the `_book.yaml` file, include `{% injectdata content _book.yaml %}` in the page and then iterate as follows:

     {% for section in page.content.toc %}
        SOME MARKUP
     {% endfor %}

Jekyll Special elements
-----------------------

* Code import: `{% highlight javascript %} {% include sample1.js %} {% endhighlight %}`
* `{{ articles _category_}}` a list of articles in divs, ordered by the "order" preamble.
* `{{ showcases _category_}}` a list of showcases.


Translations
=============================

The base content is in english under the "_langs/en" directory. Translations can be added following the same structure with either a two letter or composite language code: e.g. "es", "pt-br".

To test translations set the lang variabe in the config/local.yml. For example, to set the mode to French:

    lang: "fr"

To ensure the content is built when being released onto developers.google.com, ensure that the langs_available list in config/devsite.yml is updated to include any new language directories being added. For example, to add French:

    langs_available: ["fr"]
