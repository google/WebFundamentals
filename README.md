Web Fundamentals
================

Web Fundamentals is a technical documentation center for multi-device web development.  Our goal is to build a resource for modern web developers thatâ€™s as curated and thorough as developer.android.com or iOS Dev Center.

The project was initiated in late March and soft launched to the public on April 30th.  We're planning for a more polished 1.0 release in June.

This is a Jekyll build.

Using project-level meta data
-----------------------------

The table of contents is generated from src/site/_project.yaml

To parse the _project.yaml file include `{% injectdata content _project.yaml %}` in the page.

You then have access to the variables in the page object.


Generating Table of Contents
----------------------------

The table of contents is generated from src/site/_book.yaml

To parse the _book.yaml include `{% injectdata content _book.yaml %}` in the page and then iterate as follows:

     {% for section in page.content.toc %}
        SOME MARKUP
     {% endfor %}

Jekyll Special elements
-----------------------

Code import:

    {% highlight javascript %} {% include sample1.js %} {% endhighlight %}

`{{ articles _category_}}` a list of articles in divs, ordered by the "order" preamble.
`{{ showcases _category_}}` a list of showcases
