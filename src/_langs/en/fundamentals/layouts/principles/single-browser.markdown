Try to keep users in one place by avoiding calls-to-action that launch new windows.

For example, if you accept coupons, consider offering these on your site to 
avoid users opening new windows to search elsewhere.  Consider other ways that 
might cause a user to look outside your site and provide easy to use features 
to keep them on your site.
