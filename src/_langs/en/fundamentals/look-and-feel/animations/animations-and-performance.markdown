key-takeaways:
  code:
    - Take care that your animations don’t cause performance issues; ensure you know the impact of animating a given CSS property.
    - Animating properties that change the geometry of the page (layout) or cause painting are particularly expensive.
    - Where you can, stick to changing transforms and opacity.
    - Use <code>will-change</code> to ensure that the browser knows what you plan to animate.

Animating properties is not free, and some properties are cheaper to animate than others. For example, animating the `width` and `height` of an element changes its geometry and may cause other elements on the page to move or change size. This process is called layout (or reflow in Gecko-based browsers like Firefox), and can be expensive if your page has a lot of elements. Whenever layout is triggered, the page or part of it will normally need to be painted, which is typically even more expensive than the layout operation itself.

Where you can, you should avoid animating properties that trigger layout or paint. For most modern browsers this means limiting animations to `opacity` or `transform`, both of which can be highly optimized by the browser; it doesn’t matter if the animation is handled by JavaScript or CSS.

For a full list of the work triggered by individual CSS properties can be found at [CSS Triggers](http://csstriggers.com), and you can find a full guide on creating [High Performance Animations on HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/).

### Using the will-change property

It is worth using [`will-change`](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-will-change/) to ensure the browser knows that you intend to change an element’s property. This allows the browser to put the most appropriate optimizations in place ahead of you making the change. Care must be taken to not overuse `will-change`, however, as it can cause the browser to waste resources, which will in turn cause even more performance issues.

The general rule of thumb is that if the animation could be triggered in the next 200ms, either by a user’s interaction or because of your application’s state, then having will-change on animating elements is a good idea. For most cases, then, any element in your app’s current view that you intend to animate should have `will-change` enabled for whichever properties you plan to change. In the case of the box sample we’ve been using throughout the previous guides, adding `will-change` for transforms and opacity looks like this:

{% highlight css %}
.box {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now the browsers that support it, currently Chrome, Firefox and Opera, will make the appropriate optimizations under the hood to support changing or animating those properties.

## CSS vs JavaScript Performance

There are many pages and comments threads around the web that discuss the relative merits of CSS and JavaScript animations from a performance perspective. Here are a couple of points to keep in mind:

* CSS-based animations are typically handled on a separate thread to the browser's "main thread", where styling, layout, painting, and JavaScript are executed. This means that if the browser is running some expensive tasks on the main thread, CSS-based animations can potentially keep going without being interrupted. Changes to transforms and opacity can, in many cases, be handled by the same thread as the CSS-based animations, called the "compositor thread", so ideally you should stick to using these for your animations.
* If any animation triggers paint, layout, or both, the "main thread" will be required to do work. This is true for both CSS- and JavaScript-based animations, and the overhead of layout or paint will likely dwarf any work associated with CSS or JavaScript execution, rendering the question moot.

If you want to know exactly which work is triggered by animating a given property check [CSS Triggers](http://csstriggers.com) for more details.
