title: "How to Use the Style Guide"
description: "Web Starter Kit encourages you to develop in a style guide
  driven manner. You split up your UI into manageable chunks of Sass so that
  you can quickly see which components you are using on your site.
  This guide explains how to use and extend the style guide in WSK."
introduction: "Web Starter Kit comes with a style guide, a quick and easy way
  to view all the styles your site uses. By thinking of your CSS in terms of
  components and breaking up your styles and classes accordingly, you get a
  clean structure for your styles and you can see how all your components look
  when placed together."

## View the Style Guide HTML

To see the HTML and class names needed to add an element into your page, click
the ‘Toggle Code Snippets’ button at the top of the style guide. Once enabled
you’ll see a code example below each element with the appropriate markup which
you can copy, paste into your pages.

## Extend the Style Guide

Whenever you create a new element which will appear in various places on your
site, consider adding the element to your style guide.

### Add a New Component

1. Open `app/styleguide.html` and after the last element, add the HTML
for your new element.

2. Inside `app/styles/components/_components`, create a new Sass file with an
appropriate name for your component.

3. Open `app/styles/components.scss` and at the bottom of the file, import your
new Sass file like so.

        // New Styles
        @import "_components/_<MyComponentName>";

    Don’t forget to include the underscore in the filename; it indicates that
    the file is designed to be merged into other Sass files.

4. Test out how it looks on localhost by going to
`http://localhost:<PortNumber>/styleguide.html` and make sure the build was
successful.

5. Finally, use your new component in your pages.

### Example of How to Add a Component

Below is a simple step through of adding a component to the style guide.

1. First we add our `<footer>` tag at the bottom of `app/styleguide.html`
and give it a class name of "Footer".

2. Then we create our sass file. Here we’ll create
`app/styles/components/_components/_footer.scss` and add some really basic
styles to get us started.

        .Footer {
          height: 180px;
          background-color: #404040;
        }

3. At the bottom of `components.scss`, we add our footer sass file.

        // New Styles
        @import "_components/_footer";

4. By this point, running `gulp serve` and checking out the style guide, we
should be able to see the footer in all its glory.

5. Add a little more to our styles:

        .Footer {
          height: 180px;

          color: white;
          background-color: #404040;

          a {
              text-decoration: none;
              color: white;
          }
        }


6. Let’s add a title in `styleguide.html` so it looks like the other style
guide elements and perhaps a link at the top of the page.

        // Footer Link at top of styleguide.html
        <li class="summary-header__anchors-item">
          <a href="#footer">Footer</a>
        </li>

        .......

        // Footer Title
        <div class="container">
          <a name="footer"></a>
            <h2 class="subsection-title">
              <strong class="subsection-number">#21</strong> Footer
            </h2>
          </div>

          <!-- Input Component HTML Here -->
        </div>

7. Finally, flesh out our HTML a bit


        <footer class="Footer">
          <div class="container">
            <p>
              <a href="#">
                <i class="icon icon-chevron-up"></i> Back to top
              </a>
            </p>
          </div>
        </footer>

8. Done :)

You can now use the footer component in any page which includes the
`components.scss` file inside it (like the `app/styles/main.scss` file).

    /*
     * Visual Style Guide styles
     * Remove if you prefer to use a CSS library, like Bootstrap
     */
    @import "components/components";

{% include modules/nextarticle.liquid %}

{% endwrap %}
