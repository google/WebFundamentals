In a [research study](/web/fundamentals/principles/), 
participants became frustrated by sites that demanded registration in order 
to continue - especially if the site was an unfamiliar brand.  While getting 
access to customer information may be integral to your business, asking for 
it too early may result in fewer registrations, so donâ€™t ask for it too early.

Before offering their personal information, users want to browse content and get 
a sense of what a site has to offer.  In the study, many of the sites that 
participants rated the lowest were those where they were forced to create an 
account upfront in order to continue.
