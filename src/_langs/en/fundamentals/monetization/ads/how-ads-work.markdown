## Choose the best ads platform for your site

There are many ad serving platforms available, and choosing the one that
is right for you is important. We recommend the
[Google AdSense platform](http://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
for most sites; it's free use and available to almost any site. The [DoubleClick platform](https://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/)
is best for sites with their own advertising teams.

### AdSense

Google AdSense is a free, simple way for sites of all sizes to earn money by 
displaying targeted ads. AdSense shows ads that are relevant to your users
with automatic targeting.  You do not need to manage inventory or advertiser
relationships, AdSense gives you instant and automatic access to a huge source
of advertiser demand.

AdSense also provides you with the tools you need to be successful, including:

* Complete [customization tools](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160374) to change the look and feel of your ads.
* [Performance tools](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2973289) to monitor and optimize your ad performance.
* Tools to [manage payments](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2569265).

In addition, AdSense provides the ability to choose from a variety of ad 
sizes and formats, including
[responsive ads](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3213689) that serve
the right sized ad for responsive sites.


### DoubleClick for Publishers

DoubleClick for Publishers is an ad management platform that helps sites 
sell, schedule, deliver, and measure all of their ad inventory. Sites can
reserve some, or all of their inventory for ads from their own dedicated
advertising sales teams or auction-based services like AdSense or AdExchange.

## Get the most from your ads

### Ad placement
Place ads where they are visible, but don't detract from the main user experience. 

<img src="images/mobile_ads_placement.png" alt="Common examples of where to place mobile ads">

For example, 320&times;100px ads may be interspersed through list content, articles may
include a 300&times;250px ads, and long form content may include a combination
of ads.  Refer to [Best practices for ad placement](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1282097)
in the AdSense help for further details. 

### Ad size
For the most flexibility, use responsive ads. Responsive ads are automatically
sized based on the user's device. 

<img src="images/ad-ss-600.png" 
  srcset="images/ad-ss-1200.png 1200w, 
          images/ad-ss-900.png 900w,
          images/ad-ss-600.png 600w, 
          images/ad-ss-300.png 300w" 
  alt="Sample website with ads on desktop and mobile">

It may be necessary to use statically sized ads, in this case, refer to
the [Guide to ad sizes](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621).


### Ad type
To maximize the ad inventory available to you, be sure to choose both
text and display ads.

### Ad style
In many cases, you have control over the color, font, and font-sizing for 
text ads. Choose styles that match or contrast the styles on your site.

For example, you can change the color of URL text so that users see clearly
where the link will take them.


## How ads are targeted
Google AdSense automatically delivers ads that are [targeted to your content 
or audience](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9713).
This is done in several ways:

* **Content and language** - users will see ads that match your site's content
and language.
* **Placement** - advertisers can target sites that have ad units placed 
where they want their ads to appear, and matched to the size they want their 
ads to be displayed in on targeted devices.
* **User's interest** - your website and advertisers can target specific user 
groups, for example, sports enthusiasts.


## How ads are selected
The [ad auction](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160525)
is used to select the ads that will appear on your pages and determine how
much youâ€™ll earn from those ads. In a traditional auction, interested bidders 
state the maximum price they're willing to pay to buy a specific item. 
Similarly, our ad auction allows advertisers to state the price they're 
willing to pay for clicks on ads or for impressions served on AdSense pages.
