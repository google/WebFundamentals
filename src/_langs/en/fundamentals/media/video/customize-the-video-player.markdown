key-takeaways:
  add-a-video:
    - Use the video element to load, decode, and play video on your site.
    - Produce video in multiple formats to cover a range of mobile platforms.
    - Size videos correctly; ensure they don't overflow their containers.
    - Accessibility matters; add the track element as a child of the video element.
remember:
  media-fragments:
    - The Media Fragments API is supported on most platforms, but not on iOS.
    - Make sure Range Requests are supported by your server. Range Requests are enabled by default on most servers, but some hosting services may turn them off.
  dont-overflow:
    - Don't force element sizing that results in an aspect ratio different from the original
      video. Squashed or stretched looks bad.
  accessibility-matters:
    - The track element is supported on Chrome for Android, iOS Safari, and all current browsers on desktop except Firefox (see <a href="http://caniuse.com/track" title="Track element support status">caniuse.com/track</a>). There are several polyfills available too. We recommend <a href='//www.delphiki.com/html5/playr/' title='Playr track element polyfill'>Playr</a> or <a href='//captionatorjs.com/' title='Captionator track'>Captionator</a>.
  construct-video-streams:
    - MSE is supported by Chrome and Opera on Android, and in Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome for desktop, with support planned for <a href='http://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/MediaSourceExtensions' title='Firefox Media Source Extensions implementation timeline'>Firefox</a>.

Different platforms display video differently. Mobile solutions need to
consider device orientation. Use Fullscreen API to control the fullscreen view
of video content.

## How device orientation works across devices

Device orientation isn't an issue for desktop monitors or laptops, but is
hugely important when considering web page design for mobile and tablets.

Safari on iPhone does a good job of switching between portrait and landscape
orientation:

<div class="clear">
    <img class="g-wide--1 g-medium--half" alt="Screenshot of video playing in Safari on iPhone, portrait" src="images/iPhone-video-playing-portrait.png">
    <img class="g-wide--2 g-wide--last g-medium--half g--last" alt="Screenshot of video playing in Safari on iPhone, landscape" src="images/iPhone-video-playing-landscape.png">
</div>

Device orientation on an iPad and Chrome on Android can be problematic.
For example, without any customization a video playing on an iPad in landscape
orientation looks like this:

<img class="center" alt="Screenshot of video playing in Safari on iPad Retina, landscape"
src="images/iPad-Retina-landscape-video-playing.png">

Setting the video `width: 100%` or `max-width: 100%` with CSS can resolve
many device orientation layout problems. You may also want to consider
fullscreen alternatives.

## Inline or fullscreen display

Different platforms display video differently. Safari on an iPhone displays a
video element inline on a web page, but plays video back in fullscreen mode:

<img class="center" alt="Screenshot of video element on iPhone, portrait" src="images/iPhone-video-with-poster.png">

On Android, users can request request fullscreen mode by clicking the
fullscreen icon. But the default is to play video inline:

<img class="center" alt="Screenshot of video playing in Chrome on Android, portrait" src="images/Chrome-Android-video-playing-portrait-3x5.png">

Safari on an iPad plays video inline:

<img class="center" alt="Screenshot of video playing in Safari on iPad Retina, landscape" src="images/iPad-Retina-landscape-video-playing.png">

## Control fullscreening of content

For platforms that do not force fullscreen video playback, the Fullscreen API
is [widely supported](//caniuse.com/fullscreen). Use this API to control
fullscreening of content, or the page.

To full screen an element, like a video:
{% highlight javascript %}
elem.requestFullScreen();
{% endhighlight %}

To full screen the entire document:
{% highlight javascript %}
document.body.requestFullScreen();
{% endhighlight %}

You can also listen for fullscreen state changes:
{% highlight javascript %}
video.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", handler);
{% endhighlight %}

Or, check to see if the element is currently in fullscreen mode:
{% highlight javascript %}
console.log("In full screen mode: ", video.displayingFullscreen);
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use the CSS `:fullscreen` pseudo-class to change the way
elements are displayed in fullscreen mode.

On devices that support the Fullscreen API, consider using thumbnail
images as placeholders for video:

<video autoplay loop class="center">
  <source src="video/fullscreen.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="video/fullscreen.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <p>This browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

To see this in action, check out the {% link_sample _code/fullscreen.html %}demo{% endlink_sample %}.

**NOTE:** `requestFullScreen()` is currently vendor prefixed and may require
extra code for full cross browser compatibility.
