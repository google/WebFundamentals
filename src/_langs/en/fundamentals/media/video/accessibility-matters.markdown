title: "Accessibility matters"
description: "Accessibility isn't a feature."
introduction: "Accessibility isn't a feature. Users who can't hear or see won't be able to
              experience a video at all without captions or descriptions. The time it takes
              to add these to your video is much less than the bad experience you are
              delivering to users. Provide at least a base experience for all users."

key-takeaways:
  add-a-video:
    - Use the video element to load, decode, and play video on your site.
    - Produce video in multiple formats to cover a range of mobile platforms.
    - Size videos correctly; ensure they don't overflow their containers.
    - Accessibility matters; add the track element as a child of the video element.
remember:
  media-fragments:
    - The Media Fragments API is supported on most platforms, but not on iOS.
    - Make sure Range Requests are supported by your server. Range Requests are enabled by default on most servers, but some hosting services may turn them off.
  dont-overflow:
    - Don't force element sizing that results in an aspect ratio different from the original
      video. Squashed or stretched looks bad.
  accessibility-matters:
    - The track element is supported on Chrome for Android, iOS Safari, and all current browsers on desktop except Firefox (see <a href="http://caniuse.com/track" title="Track element support status">caniuse.com/track</a>). There are several polyfills available too. We recommend <a href='//www.delphiki.com/html5/playr/' title='Playr track element polyfill'>Playr</a> or <a href='//captionatorjs.com/' title='Captionator track'>Captionator</a>.
  construct-video-streams:
    - MSE is supported by Chrome and Opera on Android, and in Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome for desktop, with support planned for <a href='http://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/MediaSourceExtensions' title='Firefox Media Source Extensions implementation timeline'>Firefox</a>.

## Include captions to improve accessibility

To make media more accessible on mobile, include captions or descriptions
using the track element.

{% include modules/remember.liquid title="Remember" list=page.remember.accessibility-matters %}

Using the track element, captions appear like this:

 <img class="center" alt="Screenshot showing captions displayed using the track element in Chrome on Android" src="images/Chrome-Android-track-landscape-5x3.jpg">

## Add track element

It's very easy to add captions to your video &ndash; simply add a track element as a child of the video element:

{% include_code _code/track.html track html %}

The track element `src` attribute gives the location of the track file.

## Define captions in track file

A track file consists of timed 'cues' in WebVTT format:

    WEBVTT

    00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
    Man sitting on a tree branch, using a laptop.

    00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
    The branch breaks, and he starts to fall.
