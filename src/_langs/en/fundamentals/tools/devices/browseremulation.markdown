Browser emulation is great for testing a sites responsiveness, but they don’t
emulate differences in API, CSS support and certain behaviors that you'd see
on a mobile browser. Test your site on browsers running on real devices to be
certain everything behaves as expected.

## Chrome DevTools Emulation

[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) has a Device emulation tool which will create a viewport with the right width and height to match a selected device and account for the screen density.

You can activate device emulation by following these four steps:

1. With Chrome DevTools open, click the arrow icon with three horizontal lines
2. Click the mobile device in the top left.
3. Select the `Emulation` tab at the bottom.
4. Then select the device you want to test against from the drop down.

## Firefox Responsive View

Firefox has a [responsive design view](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_View)
which encourages you stop thinking in terms of specific devices and instead
explore how your design changes at common screen sizes or your own size by
dragging the edges.

To use the responsive view, open the developer tools in Firefox and click the
icon illustrated in step 1 below and use the handles at the side of the web page
to resize it, illustrated in step 2.

## IE Device Emulation

IE11 has a feature where you can [change the viewport to match a Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ie/dn255001(v=vs.85).aspx)
as well as view your site on older versions of IE.

To change the emulated browser, do the following:

1. Select the emulation tab.
2. Click the drop down labelled **Browser profile** and select your device.
