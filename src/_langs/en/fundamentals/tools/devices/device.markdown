key-takeaways:
  starter-kit:
    - There's no substitute for running your site on a real device. You must try your site on real devices.
    - BrowserSync allows you to synchronise user interactions across a number of devices at the same time.
notes:
  unit-tests:
    - If interested in running unit tests across browsers/devices, youâ€™ll need a test runner that can run your test suite on these platforms. Some options for this include <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html">Karma</a>, <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/08/25/introducing-yeti-the-yui-easy-testing-interface/">Yeti</a> and <a href="http://thrilljs.com/">Thrill</a>.

## Connect to a Local Server

One of the simplest ways to test on a real device, is to simply find the IP
address of your computer, run your web server and then point your mobile devices
to your computer's IP address.

Every OS has a different way of finding out your IP address. If you spot
the network panel on your computer, that will be the easiest way to find your
local IP address.  

OS X and Ubuntu users can always run `ifconfig` from a command prompt; Windows
users can run `ipconfig` from the command prompt.

## Use Port Forwarding to Connect to Your Server

It's often easier and more flexible to test your site using Chromes Port Forwarding
feature. This shares localhost sites from your computer, to your phone over
USB.

The first step is to enable USB debugging on your Android device. Go to
**Settings &gt; About Phone** and tap the **Build number** seven times. Then
return back to the **Settings** screen and select **Developer
Options**.

</div>

In Developer Options, make sure the **USB debugging** is checked.

Check your site running locally. In this example we have a
server running on port **3000**, so the URL is
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/):

<img src="imgs/port-forwarding-site-demo.png" alt="Demo site we are using as an example" />

Open a new tab in Chrome and type in the URL `chrome://inspect` and plug your
phone in over USB.

Clicking on the `Port Forwarding` button will allow you to enter the port your
server is on as well as a localhost port on your phone.

Make sure the 'Enable port forwarding' checkbox at the bottom of the popup
is checked. Press 'Done' and you'll be able to open http://localhost:3000 on
your mobile device and see your site.

## Using DevTools for Mobile Browsers

Each browser/platform has its own way to debug sites. Use the appropriate
DevTools to help debug problems.

### Chrome for Android

You can use Chrome DevTools with Chrome for Android by setting up your device
for development and then visiting `chrome://inspect`. [Check out our Chrome
docs](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging) on how to set
all of this up.

### Safari for iOS

To debug Safari for iOS, follow these steps:

1. Open Safari on your iOS device.
1. Connect it to your computer via USB.
1. Open Safari on your computer.
1. In Safari's menu, go to `Develop` and, look for your devices name.
1. Select the tab you want to debug.

### IE for Windows Phone

Unfortunately there is no way to debug a site on Windows Phone, but you can  
[emulate a mobile browser on the desktop version of IE
11](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn255001%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).
We'll cover this in the [next article](browseremulation.html).

## Sync Devices with BrowserSync

If you have a large number of devices to test against, you may find it
overwhelming to do a basic test across all of the devices. [Browser
Sync](http://www.browsersync.io/) can help with this by synchronising
interactions across all of your devices. This includes scrolling, clicking and
form entry.

</div>

BrowserSync is enabled out of the box with [Web Starter
Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/), so try it out there or
check out the gulp file for how to integrate it in your own workflow.

If you aren't using Gulp, head on over to the [BrowserSync
site](http://www.browsersync.io/) for alternative approaches to using it.
