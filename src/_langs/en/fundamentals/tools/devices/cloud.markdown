The one big advantage of cloud-based emulators over real devices and local
emulators is that you can automate unit tests for your site across different
platforms.

## BrowserStack

[BrowserStack (commercial)](https://www.browserstack.com/automate) is the
easiest to use for manual testing. You select an operating system,
select your browser version and device type, select a URL to browse, and it
spins up a hosted virtual machine that you can interact with.

You can also fire up multiple emulators in the same screen, letting you test how
your app looks and feels across multiple devices at the same time.

## SauceLabs

[SauceLabs (Commercial)](https://saucelabs.com/) allows you to run unit tests
inside of an emulator, which can be really useful for scripting a flow through
your site and watch the video recording of this afterwards on various devices.

You can also do manual testing with your site.

## Device Anywhere

Unlike BrowserStack and SauceLabs, [Device Anywhere
(commercial)](http://www.keynote.com/solutions/testing/mobile-testing) doesn't
use emulators, it uses real devices which you can control remotely.

This is very useful in the event where you need to reproduce a problem on a
specific device and can't see the bug on any of the options in the previous guides.
