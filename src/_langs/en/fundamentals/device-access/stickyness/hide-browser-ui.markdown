{% wrap content %}

Add the following code to the `<head>` of your page:

{% highlight html %}
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
{% endhighlight %}


This will tell Mobile Safari that it's dealing 
with a web app.

Internet Explorer doesn't require instructions for this, as 
sites will launch fullscreen by default

<div class="clear g-wide--full">
    <figure class="fluid">
        <img src="images/web-app-capable.png" alt="web-app-capable">
        
        <figcaption>Launching a Site with Web App Capable Meta Tag</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

{% include modules/nextarticle.liquid %}

{% endwrap %}
