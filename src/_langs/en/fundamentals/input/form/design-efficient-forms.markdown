## Minimize repeated actions and fields

Make sure your forms have no repeated actions, only as many fields as 
necessary, and take advantage of 
[autofill](/web/fundamentals/input/form/label-and-name-inputs.html#use-metadata-to-enable-auto-complete),
so that users can easily complete forms with pre-populated data.

    On the Progressive.com website, users are asked first for their ZIP code, which is then pre-populated into the next part of the form.

Look for opportunities to pre-fill information you already know, or may 
anticipated to save the user from having to provide it.  For example, 
pre-populate the shipping address with the last shipping address supplied by 
the user.

## Show users how far along they are

Progress bars and menus should accurately convey overall progress through 
multi-step forms and processes.

If you place a disproportionately complex form in an earlier step, users 
are more likely to abandon your site before they go through the entire process. 


## Provide visual calendars when selecting dates

Users often need more context when scheduling appointments and travel dates, 
to make things easier and prevent them from leaving your site to check their 
calendar app, provide a visual calendar with clear labeling for selecting 
start and end dates.
