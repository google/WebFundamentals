Here are two Chrome Extensions that have some useful functionality to help with
debugging your designs.

{% include modules/toc.liquid %}

## Emmet Re:View

Emmet Re:View is a tool which makes it easy to see what your site looks like at
each of your media queries and syncs the scrolling of all the pages. You can see
a demo of it [on their
site](http://re-view.emmet.io/).

[Download on the Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emmet-review/epejoicbhllgiimigokgjdoijnpaphdp)

## What Font?

The last extension we use on a regular basis is *What Font?*. This Chrome Extension
will tell you the name of the font currently being used on the page. This is
really handy for debugging any web font issues.
