key-takeaways:
  tldr:   
    - Place your site search near the top of your homepage via an open text field.  
    - Make sure your site search returns the strongest results first, and implement smart-search features like autocomplete and spelling corrections.  
    - Offer filters to help users get what they need from search, but make sure users can't filter a search to return zero results.   
    - If your offerings can be easily narrowed by segment, asking a few questions upfront helps ensure visitors see relevant results.

## Make site search visible

Users looking for specific information usually turn to search - so search should 
be one of the first things mobile users see on your site, avoid hiding it behind 
a menu. In the study, participants responded best to easily-visible, open text 
search boxes at the top of a page.

## Ensure site search results are relevant

Search should be smart, providing users with the best and most relevant results 
so they don't have to swipe through multiple pages of results. Make life easier 
for users with smart-search features like autocomplete, corrected misspellings 
and suggesting search terms or providing related matches.

Participants didn't bother to swipe through multiple pages of search results. 
Instead, they judged a site's search based on the results it returned first, so 
make sure your first page of search results are the strongest. 

## Implement filters to narrow results

Provide easy to use filters to help narrow the search results to more relevant 
results for users.  Participants relied on filters to narrow down search 
results, and actually abandoned sites that couldn't reduce volume. However, you 
also need to ensure users don't filter themselves into a box - one car dealer 
site allowed participants to specify configurations that didn't actually exist. 
Help users avoid problems by letting them know how many results will be returned 
with a particular filter applied.

Don't bury the filters at the bottom of the page where users have to scroll to 
the end of the result set before they can begin to filter what they're looking 
for.

## Guide users to better site search results

For sites that serve diverse customer segments, it can be helpful to ask users a 
few questions before they search to ensure they get results from the most 
relevant content segment.

For example, a large shoe retailer began its mobile searches by having 
participants select the gender and size of shoe they were looking for.
