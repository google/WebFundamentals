In a [research study](/web/fundamentals/principles/), participants didn't 
necessarily want to commit to creating an account with the retailer. 
Participants described the guest checkout as <b>"convenient"</b>, <b>"simple"</b>, 
and <b>"easy [and] quick"</b>. They were annoyed at a site that required 
registration to purchase, especially since the site didn't explain how 
registration would benefit them.
