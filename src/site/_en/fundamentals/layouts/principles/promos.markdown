[Participants](/web/fundamentals/principles/research-study.html)
visiting one company's mobile site were distracted by a large promotional 
banner and missed the navigational buttons beneath it, making it hard for 
them to learn more about the company's offerings.

For app promotions, use easily dismissible banners, which were preferred by 
study participants; as opposed to large interstitials (also known as door 
slams).
