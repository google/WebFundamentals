When [study participants](/web/fundamentals/principles/research-study.html) 
saw an option for "full site" vs "mobile site", they assumed the mobile site 
was condensed and chose the full site instead. One participant preferred the 
desktop site because it had "so much more information" - even though the 
mobile and desktop sites had the same content.
