{% wrap content %}

Add the following code to the `<head>` of your page:

{% highlight html %}
<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
{% endhighlight %}


This will tell both Mobile Safari and Chrome for Android that they're dealing 
with a web app. Internet Explorer doesn't require instructions for this, as 
sites open fullscreen in Windows' start screen experience from the get-go.

{% include modules/nextarticle.liquid %}

{% endwrap %}
