          Learn how we built a the Google I/O 2016 Progressive Web App (IOWA)
          using web components, Polymer, and material design and launched it 
          into production on Google.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          IOWA is a single page application (SPA) that's built using web 
          components, Polymer, Firebase, and has an extensive backend written 
          in App Engine (Go). It pre-caches content for offline users using a 
          service worker, dynamically loads new pages, gracefully transitions 
          between views, and reuses content after first load.

          Flipkart triples time-on-site with Progressive Web App
        </h4>
        <p>
          In 2015, Flipkart, India’s largest e-commerce site, adopted an
          app-only strategy and temporarily shut down their mobile website.
          The company found it harder and harder to provide a user experience
          that was as fast and engaging as that of their mobile app. But then,
          Flipkart decided to rethink their development approach. They were
          drawn back to the mobile web by the introduction of features that
          made the mobile web run instantly, work offline, and re-engage users.
