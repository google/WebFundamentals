### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }

Land Lines is an experiment that lets you explore Google Earth satellite images 
through gesture. Using a combination of machine learning, data optimization, 
and graphics card power, the experiment is able to run efficiently on your 
phone's web browser without a need for backend servers. This is a look into our 
development process and the various approaches we tried leading us to the final 
result.

When the Data Arts team approached me about exploring a data set of earth images 
I was quite excited &mdash; the images were beautiful, revealing all different kinds 
of structures and textures, both human made and natural, and I was intrigued 
with how to connect this data set. I did a variety of initial experiments 
looking at image similarity and different ways of filtering and organizing them.

As a group we kept coming back to the beautiful and dominant lines in the 
images. These lines were easy to spot &mdash; highways, rivers, edges of mountains 
and plots of land &mdash; and we designed a few projects to explore these. As an 
artist I was inspired by the beautiful things you can do with collections of 
lines &mdash; see for example
[Cassandra C Jones's work with lightning](http://www.cassandracjones.com/lightning-drawing-series)
&mdash; and I was excited to work with this data set. 

## Line Detection

One of the initial challenges was how to detect lines in the images. It's easy 
to take out a piece of tracing paper, throw it on top of a printout of one of 
these photos, and draw the lines that your eye sees but in general computer 
vision algorithms for finding lines tend to not work well across very diverse 
images. 

I developed a previous version of the search by drawing algorithm on a project 
with [Local Projects](https://localprojects.net/) and for that we hand annotated 
the lines to search for. It was fun to draw on top of artworks but tedious as 
you move from dozens of images to thousands. I wanted to try to automate the 
process of finding lines. 

With these aerial images I tried traditional line detection algorithms like 
openCv's [canny edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)
algorithm but found they gave either very discontinuous line segments or if the
threshold were too relaxed, tons of spurious lines. Also, the thresholds to
get good results were different across different image sets and I wanted an
algorithm for finding a consistent set of good lines without supervision.

I experimented with a variety of line detection algorithms including recent ones 
like [gPb (PDF)](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/papers/amfm_pami2010.pdf)
which  although producing amazing results, required minutes to run per image.
In the end I settled with
[Structured Forest edge detection](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d0/da5/tutorial_ximgproc_prediction.html), 
an algorithm that ships with [openCV](http://opencv.org/). 
 
Once I had a good "line image", I still had the problem of actually getting the 
lines and identifying individual lines from each other &mdash; i.e., how do I take 
this raster data and make it vector. Often times when I'm looking at computer 
vision problems, I investigate [imageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), an open 
source java based image processing environment used by scientists and 
researchers which has a healthy ecosystem of 
[plugins](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/). I found a plugin called
[ridge detection](http://imagej.net/Ridge_Detection), which helps take an
intensity image and turn that into a set of line segments. (As a side note,
I also found this [edge detection and labeling](http://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/#edgelink)
code from Matlab useful).

## Serverless

I also wanted to see if it's possible to do a data visualization app that's 
essentially serverless, where the hard work of matching and connecting happens 
client side. I usually work in [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), a 
c++ framework for creative coding and besides the occasional 
[node](https://nodejs.org/) project I haven't done a lot of server side coding. 
I was curious if it's possible to do all of the calculation client side and to 
only use the server just for serving json and image data. 

For the draw application, the matching is a very heavy operation. When you draw 
a line, we need to find the closest match among over tens of thousands of line 
segments. To calculate the distance of one drawing to another we use a metric 
from [dollar gesture recognizer](https://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/)
which itself involves many distance calculations. In the past, I've used threading and 
other tricks but in order to make it work in real time on a client device 
(including mobile phones) I needed something better. I looked into
[metric trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tree) for finding closest/nearest 
neighbors and I settled on [vantage point trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantage-point_tree)
([javascript implementation](http://fpirsch.github.io/vptree.js/)). The vantage
point tree basically gets built off a set of data and a distance metric and 
when you put in a new piece of data it gives you quite quickly a list of the
closest values. The first time I saw this work on a mobile phone instantly I
was floored. One of the great benefits of this particular vantage point tree
implementation is that you can [save out the tree](https://github.com/fpirsch/vptree.js)
after it's computed and save on the costs of computing this tree.

    side and the closest results are on the left.

Another challenge of making it work without a server is getting the data loaded
onto a mobile device &mdash; For draw, the tree and line segment data was over 12mb
and the images are quite large, we wanted the experience to feel quick and
responsive and the goal is to was try to keep the download small. Our solution
was to progressively load data. In the draw app we split the vantage point tree
data set into 5 pieces and when the app loads it only loads the first chunk and
then every 10 seconds it loads another chunk of data in the background, so
essentially the app gets better and better for the first minute of being used.
In the drag app was also worked hard to cache images so that as you drag, new
images are loaded in the background.

Finally, one thing I found harder than expected was making a pre-loader for both
apps, so you the initial delay as data loads would be understandable. I used the
[progress callback](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19126994/what-is-the-cleanest-way-to-get-the-progress-of-jquery-ajax-request)
on the ajax requests and on the pixi.js side, checked images that were loading
asynchronously had actually loaded and use that to drive the preload message.

## Connected Line

For drag, I wanted to create an endless line from the lines we found in the edge 
detection. The first step was to filter lines from the line detection algorithm 
and identify long lines that start on one edge and end on one of the three other 
edges.

Once I had a set of long lines (or to use a more accurate term, 
[polylines](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polyline.html), a collection of 
connected points) in order to connect them I converted these lines into a set of 
angle changes. Usually when you think of a polyline you imagine it as a set of 
points: point a is connected to point b which is connected to point c. Instead, 
you can treat the line as a set of angle changes: Move forward and rotate some 
amount, move forward and rotate some amount. A good way to visualize this is to 
think about [wire bending machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSi9ew4bU6o),
which take a piece of wire and as it's being extruded perform rotations.
The shape of the drawing comes from turning. 

If you consider the line as angle changes and not points, it becomes easier to 
combine lines into one larger line with less discontinuities &mdash; rather than 
stitching points you are essentially adding relative angle changes. In order to 
add a line, you take the current angle of the main line aimage0nd add to it the 
relative changes of the line you want to add. 

As a side note, I've used this technique of converting a line into a set of 
angle changes for artistic exploitation &mdash; you can make drawings "uncurl" similar 
to how wire can curl and uncurl. Some examples: 
[one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLdawsdhDje/?taken-by=zach.lieberman), 
[two](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLps0gkB0F-/?taken-by=zach.lieberman), 
[three](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM4Qd8ZhbrH/?taken-by=zach.lieberman)

This angle calculation is what allows us to steer the line as you drag &mdash; we 
calculate how off the main angle is from where we want to be and we look for a 
picture that will help the most getting the line going in the right direction. 
It's all a matter of thinking relatively.

Finally, I just want to say that this was a really fun project to be involved 
with. It's exciting as an artist to be asked to use a data set as lovely as 
these images and I'm honored the Data Arts team reached out. I hope you have 
fun experimenting with it!
