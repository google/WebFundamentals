We're in the process of restructuring our PWA training resources.

You can still use the materials linked to from this page, but some of the content may be out of date.

We're still working on updated written materials, but check out our videos and codelabs:

* The most up to date PWA codelabs are at codelabs.developers.google.com/dev-pwa-training.

* The [Progressive Web App Training playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIB2xHBZ7opgc2Mv009X87Hh) includes our most recent videos.
