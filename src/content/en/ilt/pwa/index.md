The way we access the internet has changed. With the growth of smartphones
and mobile devices, we are seeing millions of people from around the world
using the internet for the first time on a mobile device. Google is
supporting Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to help developers provide
native-app qualities in web applications that are reliable, fast,
and engaging. 

This course is aimed at:

* Beginning-to-intermediate web developers.
* Web developers who are comfortable using HTML, CSS, and have modest
  facility with JavaScript.
* Developers who want to build web experiences that work for everyone. 

This course shows you how to convert web pages to PWAs. A PWA is not an API
or a technology, but it is a web development approach that uses a combination
of tools and technologies already available to create targeted, ideal user
experiences. It shows how to use service workers, APIs, and an application
shell architecture for meaningful offline experiences, fast first load, and
easy user reengagement upon repeat visits.

## Course Materials

### Codelabs

Our codelabs provide a guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience. Most
codelabs step you through the process of adding a new feature to an
existing application. The codelabs can be completed in any order.
However, the more advanced codelabs build on the fundamentals covered
in the earlier codelabs. Each codelab has the recommended prerequisites
listed at the start. 

### Concepts

Each codelab has an accompanying text that explains the concepts in the
codelab in more detail. Links to corresponding texts are included at the
top of each codelab.
