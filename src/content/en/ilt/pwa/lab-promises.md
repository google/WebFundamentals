## 1. Get set up




If you have not downloaded the repository and installed the  [LTS version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), follow the instructions in [Setting up the labs](setting-up-the-labs).

Open your computer's command line interface. Navigate into the `promises-lab/app/` directory and start a local development server:

    cd promises-lab/app
    npm install
    node server.js

You can terminate the server at any time with `Ctrl-c`.

`npm install` installs the `express` package, which is used by the development server (`server.js`).

Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8081/`.

Note: [Unregister](tools-for-pwa-developers#unregister) any service workers and [clear all service worker caches](tools-for-pwa-developers#clearcache) for localhost so that they do not interfere with the lab. In Chrome DevTools, you can achieve this by clicking __Clear site data__ from the __Clear storage__ section of the __Application__ tab.

Open the `promises-lab/app/` folder in your preferred text editor. The `app/` folder is where you will be building the lab.

This folder contains:

* `flags/chile.png`, `flags/peru.png`, `flags/spain.png` - sample resources that we use to experiment
* `js/main.js` is the main JavaScript file for the app
* `test/test.html` is a file for testing your progress
* `index.html` is the main HTML page for our sample site/application
* `package.json` & `package-lock.json` keep track of the development server dependencies
* `server.js` is a local development server for testing

## 2. Using promises




A  [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. This sections describes how to use Promises to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.

### 2.1 Create a promise

Let's start by creating a simple promise.

Replace the `getImageName` function in `js/main.js` with the following code:

```
function getImageName(country) {
  country = country.toLowerCase();
  const promiseOfImageName = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (country === 'spain' || country === 'chile' || country === 'peru') {
        resolve(country + '.png');
      } else {
        reject(Error('Didn\'t receive a valid country name!'));
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
  console.log(promiseOfImageName);
  return promiseOfImageName;
}
```

Save the code and refresh the page.

Enter "Spain" into the app's __Country Name__ field. Then, click __Get Image Name__. You should see a  [Promise object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) logged in the console.

Now enter "Hello World" into the __Country Name__ field and click __Get Image Name__. You should see another Promise object logged in the console, followed by an error.

Note: Navigate to `localhost:8081/test/test.html` in the browser to check your function implementations. Functions that are incorrectly implemented or unimplemented show red errors. You should be passing the first test that checks if the `getImageName` function was implemented correctly

#### Explanation

The `getImageName` function creates a  [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). A promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. In effect, a promise lets an asynchronous function such as `getImageName` (the `setTimeout` method is used to make `getImageName` asynchronous) return a value much like a synchronous function. Rather than returning the final value (in this case, "Spain.png"), `getImageName` returns a promise of a future value (this is what you see in the console log). Promise construction typically looks like  [this example at developers.google.com](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises#promises_arrive_in_javascript):

```
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // do a thing, possibly async, then...

  if (/* everything turned out fine */) {
    resolve("Stuff worked!");
  }
  else {
    reject(Error("It broke"));
  }
});
```

Depending on the outcome of an asynchronous operation, a promise can either  [resolve](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve) with a value or  [reject](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject) with an error. In the `getImageName` function, the `promiseOfImageName` promise either resolves with an image filename, or rejects with a custom error signifying that the function input was invalid.

__Optional__: Complete the `isSpain` function so that it takes a string as input, and returns a new promise that resolves if the function input is "Spain", and rejects otherwise. You can verify that you implemented `isSpain` correctly by navigating to `localhost:8081/test/test.html` and checking the `isSpain` test. Note that this exercise is optional and is not used in the app.

### 2.2. Use the promise

This section uses the promise we just created.

Update the `flagChain` function in `js/main.js` with the following code:

```
function flagChain(country) {
  return getImageName(country)
  .then(logSuccess, logError);
}
```

Save the script and refresh the page.

Enter "Spain" into the app's __Country Name__ field again.

Now click __Fetch Flag Image__. In addition to the promise object, "spain.png" should now be logged.

Now enter "Hello World" into the __Country Name__ text input and click __Fetch Flag Image__ again. You should see another promise logged in the console, followed by a custom error message.

#### Explanation

The `flagChain` function returns the result of `getImageName`, which is a promise. The  [then](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) method lets us implicitly pass the settled (either resolved or rejected) promise to another function. The `then` method takes two arguments in the following order:

1. The function to be called if the promise resolves.
2. The function to be called if the promise rejects.

If the first function is called, then it is implicitly passed the resolved promise value. If the second function is called, then it is implicitly passed the rejection error.

Note: We used named functions inside `then` as good practice, but we could use  [anonymous functions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Anonymous_functions) as well.

### 2.3 Use catch for error handling

Let's look at the `catch` method, which is a clearer alternative for error handling.

Replace the `flagChain` function with the following:

```
function flagChain(country) {
  return getImageName(country)
  .then(logSuccess)
  .catch(logError);
}
```

Save the script and refresh the page. Repeat the experiments from section 2.2 and note that the results are identical.

#### Explanation

The  [catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch) method is similar to `then`, but deals only with rejected cases. It behaves like `then(undefined, onRejected)`. With this new pattern, if the promise from `getImageName` resolves, then `logSuccess` is called (and is implicitly passed the resolved promise value). If the promise from `getImageName` rejects, then `logError` is called (and implicitly passed the rejection error).

This code is not quite equivalent to the code in section 2.2, however. This new code also triggers `catch` if `logSuccess` rejects, because `logSuccess` occurs before the `catch`. This new code would actually be equivalent to the following:

```
return getImageName(country)
.then(logSuccess)
.then(undefined, logError);
```

The difference is subtle, but extremely useful. Promise rejections skip forward to the next `then` with a rejection callback (or `catch`, since they're equivalent). With `then(func1, func2)`, `func1` or `func2` will be called, never both. But with `then(func1).catch(func2)`, both will be called if `func1` rejects, as they're separate steps in the chain.

## 3. Chaining promises




The `then` and `catch` methods also return promises, making it possible to chain promises together.

### 3.1 Add asynchronous steps

Replace the code in the `flagChain` function with the following:

```
function flagChain(country) {
  return getImageName(country)
  .then(fetchFlag)
  .then(processFlag)
  .then(appendFlag)
  .catch(logError);
}
```

Save the script and refresh the page.

Enter "Spain" into the app's __Country Name__ text input. Now click __Fetch Flag Image__. You should see the Spanish flag display on the page.

Now enter "Hello World" into the __Country Name__ text input and click __Fetch Flag Image__. The console should show that the error is triggering the `catch` (logging the custom error we saw earlier).

#### Explanation

The updated `flagChain` function does the following:

1. As before, `getImageName` returns a promise. The promise either resolves with an image file name, or rejects with an error, depending on the function's input.
2. If the returned promise resolves, then the image file name is passed to `fetchFlag` inside the first `then`. This function requests the corresponding image file asynchronously, and returns a promise (see  [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch) documentation).
3. If the promise from `fetchFlag` resolves, then the resolved value (a  [response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object) is passed to `processFlag` in the next `then`. The `processFlag` function checks if the response is ok, and throws an error if it is not. Otherwise, it processes the response with the `blob` method, which also returns a promise.
4. If the promise from `processFlag` resolves, the resolved value (a  [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)), is passed to the `appendFlag` function. The `appendFlag` function creates an image from the value and appends it to the DOM.

If any of the promises reject, then all subsequent `then` blocks are skipped, and `catch` executes, calling `logError`. Throwing an error in the `processFlag` function also triggers the `catch` block.

### 3.2 Optional: Add a recovery catch

The `flagChain` function does not add a flag to the page if an invalid country is used as input (`getImageName` rejects and execution skips to the `catch` block).

Add a `catch` to the promise chain that uses the `fallbackName` function to supply a fallback image file name to the `fetchFlag` function if an invalid country is supplied to `flagChain`. To verify this was added correctly, navigate to `localhost:8081/test/test.html` and check the `flagChain` test.

Save the script and refresh the page. Enter "Hello World" in the __Country Name__ field and click __Fetch Flag Image__. Now the Chilean flag should display even though an invalid input was passed to `flagChain`.

#### Explanation

Because `catch` returns a promise, you can use the `catch` method inside a promise chain to  *recover*  from earlier failed operations.

## 4. Optional: Using Promise.all and Promise.race




### 4.1 Promise.all

Often we want to take action only after a collection of asynchronous operations have completed successfully.

Write your own code to complete the `allFlags` function according to the following guidelines

(assume the function takes a list of promises as input):

1. The function should use  [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) to evaluate the list of promises.
2. If all promises resolve successfully, then `allFlags` returns the values of the resolved promises as a list. Otherwise, `allFlags` returns `false`.

To verify that you have done this correctly, navigate to `localhost:8081/test/test.html` and check the `allFlags` test.

Test what you've written by calling `allFlags` just below the function  using the following code:

```
var promises = [
  getImageName('Spain'),
  getImageName('Chile'),
  getImageName('Peru')
];

allFlags(promises).then(function(result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Save the script and refresh the page. The console should log each promise object and show `["spain.png", "chile.png", "peru.png"]`.

Note: In this example we are using an  [anonymous function](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Anonymous_functions) inside the `then` call. This is not related to `Promise.all`.

Change one of the inputs in the `getImageName` calls inside the `promises` variable to "Hello World". Save the script and refresh the page. Now the console should log `false`.

#### Explanation

`Promise.all` returns a promise that resolves if all of the promises passed into it resolve. If any of the passed-in promises reject, then `Promise.all` rejects with the reason of the first promise that was rejected. This is very useful for ensuring that a group of asynchronous actions complete (such as multiple images loading) before proceeding to another step.

Note: `Promise.all` would not work if the promises passed in were from `flagChain` calls because `flagChain` uses `catch` to ensure that the returned promise always resolves.

Note: Even if an input promise rejects, causing `Promise.all` to reject, the remaining input promises still settle. In other words, the remaining promises still execute, they simply are not returned by `Promise.all`.

#### For more information

*  [Promise.all documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)

### 4.2 Promise.race

Another promise method that you may see referenced is  [Promise.race](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race).

Add the following code to `js/main.js` below the code we added in the previous step:

```
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
.then(logSuccess)
.catch(logError);
```

Save the script and refresh the page. The console should show "two" logged by `logSuccess`.

Change `promise2` to reject instead of resolve. Save the script and refresh the page. Observe that "two" is logged again, but this time by `logError`.

#### Explanation

`Promise.race` takes a list of promises and settles as soon as the first promise in the list settles. If the first promise resolves, `Promise.race` resolves with the corresponding value, if the first promise rejects, `Promise.race` rejects with the corresponding reason.

In this example, if `promise2` resolves before `promise1` settles, the `then` block executes and logs the value of `promise2`. If `promise2` rejects before `promise1` settles, the `catch` block executes and logs the reason for the `promise2` rejection.

Note: Because `Promise.race` rejects immediately if one of the supplied promises rejects (even if another supplied promise resolves later) `Promise.race` by itself can't be used to reliably return the first promise that resolves. See the  [concepts section](working-with-promises#race) for more details.
