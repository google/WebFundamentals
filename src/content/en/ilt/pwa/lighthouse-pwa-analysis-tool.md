# Lighthouse PWA Analysis Tool {: .page-title }




Codelab:  [Auditing with Lighthouse](lab-auditing-with-lighthouse)

<div id="introduction"></div>


## Introduction




How do I tell if all of my Progressive Web App (PWA) features are in order?  [Lighthouse](/web/tools/lighthouse/) is an  [open-source](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) tool from Google that audits a web app for PWA features. It provides a set of metrics to help guide you in building a PWA with a full application-like experience for your users. 

Lighthouse tests if your app:

* Can load in offline or flaky network conditions
* Is relatively fast
* Is served from a secure origin
* Uses certain accessibility best practices

Lighthouse is available as a Chrome extension for Chrome 52 (and later) and a command line tool.

## Running Lighthouse as a Chrome extension




Download the Lighthouse Chrome extension from the  [Chrome Web Store](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk). 

When installed it places an <img src="img/91e97511ef44e440.png" style="width:20px;height:20px;" alt="Lighthouse Icon ">  icon in your taskbar. 

Run Lighthouse on your application by selecting the icon and choosing __Generate report__ (with your app open in the browser page).

Lighthouse generates an HTML page with the results. An example page is shown below.

Note: You can test it out on an example PWA, <a href="https://www.airhorner.com/">airhorner.com</a>.

## Running Lighthouse from the command line




If you want to run Lighthouse from the command line (for example, to integrate it with a build process) it is available as a  [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) module. 

You can download Node from  [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) (select the version that best suits your environment and operating system). 



Note: You need Node v6 or greater to run Lighthouse.



To install Lighthouse's Node module from the command line, use the following command:

    npm install -g lighthouse

This installs the tool globally. You can then run Lighthouse from the command line (where  [https://airhorner.com/](https://airhorner.com/) is your app):

    lighthouse https://airhorner.com/


You can check Lighthouse flags and options with the following command:

    lighthouse --help
