All article sources are in `src/content`. The base content is in English
under the `en` directory. Add translations by following the same structure
with either a two letter or composite language code: e.g. `es`, `pt-br`.

Our supported languages include: Arabic (AR), German (DE), Spanish (ES),
French (FR), Hebrew (HE), Bahasa Indonesia (ID), Italian (IT), Japanese (JA),
Korean (KO), Dutch (NL), Polish (PL), Portugese (PT-BR), Russian (RU),
Turkish (TR), Chinese Traditional (ZH-TW) and Chinese Simplified (ZH-CN).

1.  Create the root language code in `src/content` if it does not exist for the
    language you are translating.  For example create `src/content/es` for
    Spanish.
1.  Create the article in the same directory hierarchy but under this new
    directory.

    (`src/data/_contributors.yaml`)
