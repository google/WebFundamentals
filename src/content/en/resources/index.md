Want to get involved in [/web](/web/)? We **love** our
[contributors](contributors). By submitting bug reports, pull requests and
helping to [translate](translations) content into more than 15 different
languages, **you've** helped to make [/web](/web/) and the web better!

## Found an issue or something need to be updated?

You can [file an issue](https://github.com/Google/WebFundamentals/issues) on
our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Google/WebFundamentals/){: .external } and
someone will take a look, or you can fix it yourself by submitting a
[pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request)!

## Want to help translate content?

Translating content is a great place to start! Check out our
[translation guidelines](translations) for more details on how to get started.

## Submitting a pull request {: #submitting-a-pull-request }

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we 
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

### Contributor License Agreements

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License 
Agreement.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you 
own the intellectual property, then sign an [individual CLA](/open-source/cla/individual).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, 
then sign a [corporate CLA](/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and 
instructions for how to sign and return it.

1. Sign the contributors license agreement above.
2. Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes
that addresses one issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Google/WebFundamentals/issues).
Please don't mix more than one logical change per submission, because it makes
the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change
(e.g. add a sample or feature) that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the
issue tracker, please create one.
3. **Submitting**: When you are ready to submit, send us a Pull Request. Be
sure to include the issue number you've fixed and the name you used to sign
the CLA.

### Article Styles

Looking for the [sample article](writing-an-article) and
[markdown syntax guide](markdown-syntax), this is it.

### Code Styles

If your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows 
[the style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml).
Otherwise, we will have to ask you to make changes, and that's no fun for anyone.

### Other Tips

To simplify PR reviews, please word-wrap HTML files at 80 characters or fewer.
