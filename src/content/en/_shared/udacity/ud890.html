    Any meaningful experience on the web has a form. Whether it's a form made of
    text boxes, toggles, buttons, checkboxes, or touchable widgets, web
    developers need to be purposeful about forms to make users happy and
    increase conversions.
  </p>
  <p itemprop="description">
    In this course, you'll learn best practices for modern forms. You'll
    practice your skills along the way with a few self-directed projects,
    including an e-commerce checkout and an event planner app!
  </p>
  <p>
    As a special treat, you'll also watch a series of interviews with Luke
    Wroblewski, Google Product Director and author of Web Form Design, to get
    his take on interactions for the modern web.
