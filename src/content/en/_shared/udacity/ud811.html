    In this course you’ll get started working on your very first Progressive
    Web App - a web app that can take advantage of many of the features native
    applications have enjoyed. You’ll also get more experience in creating a
    web app that works offline using Service Workers. Finally, you’ll make your
    app installable to the user’s home screen with the Web App Manifest file.
