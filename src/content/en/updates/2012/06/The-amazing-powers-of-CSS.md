# The amazing powers of CSS {: .page-title }

Yesterday at the office, we were coming up with strange and magical CSS tricks. Take this one for instance, it makes empty links very visible:


    a[href = ""] {
      background: red;
      color: white;
      font-size: x-large;
    }
    
Check out the [live example at jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/VWYsk/){: .external }

You can also style absolute links differently from relative links:


    a[href ^= http] {
      display: inline-block;
      color: red;
      transform: rotate(180deg);
    }

If you want to have a different style for links pointing out of your domain, you can use the :not() selector. This is actually how we do the little arrows next to external links at HTML5Rocks.


    a[href ^= 'http']:not([href *= 'html5rocks.']) {
      background: transparent url(arrow.png) no-repeat center right;
      padding-right: 16px;
    }

Just to remind you that you're not limited to styling links, here's how to make all PNG images inverted:


    img[src $= .png] {
      filter: invert(100%);
    }
    

Moving on from attribute selectors, did you know that you can make the document head visible, along with the other elements there?


    head {
      display: block;
      border-bottom: 5px solid red;
    }
    script, style, link {
      display: block;
      white-space: pre;
      font-family: monospace;
    }
    

Or that you can use the awesome power of CSS attr-function to fill in the :after and :before content?


    script:before {
      content: "<script src=\"" attr(src) "\" type=\"" attr(type) "\">";
    }
    script:after {
      content: "</script>";
    }
    
    style:before {
      content: "<style type=\"" attr(type) "\">";
    }
    style:after {
      content: "< /style>";
    }
    
    /* And for a finish, <link> */
    link:before {
      content: "<link rel=\"" attr(rel) "\" type=\"" attr(type) "\" href=\"" attr(href) "\" />";
    }
    

Check out the [live example at jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Wedjf/1/){: .external }

Note that attr() reads in the attribute values of the matching element, so if you use it for #foo:before, it reads the attributes from #foo.
