# Quick FAQs on input[type=date] in Google Chrome {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/agektmr.html" %}


* This article is written by a Chrome software engineer [Kent Tamura](https://plus.google.com/104770450049736549185/about).

As you might have already noticed, [Google Chrome supports a datepicker since Chrome 20](https://plus.google.com/107085977904914121234/posts/R5LyvTSa21k). Just by setting the `type` attribute of the `input` element to `date`, the user can click the arrow button and Chrome will pop up a nice calendar widget.

As we have received a lot of feedback from developers, we'd like to clarify a few things about how to get the best out of using the date picker in this article.

### How does locale affect the date format of the input value?

Users can type a date value into the text field of an `input[type=date]` with the date format shown in the box as gray text. This format is obtained from the operating system's setting.

![format](/web/updates/images/2012-08-06-quick-faqs-on-input-type-date-in-google-chrome/date-formats.jpg)

Web authors have no way to change the date format because there currently is no standards to specify the format.

### How is the input value represented when sending to a server?

The date value interpreted from `input[type=date]` in the HTTP Request such as GET / POST will be formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`.

### What kind of format does the input value return?

The `input.value` always returns as `yyyy-mm-dd` regardless of the presentation format.

### What kind of format does the input value accept?

When setting the `input.value` programmatically, the value accepts only `yyyy-mm-dd` style regardless of the presentation format for both the initial value and the JavaScript injected value.

### How do I change the appearance of the date picker?

You cannot currently style the appearance of the date picker.  In WebKit, we have previously provided ways to style form controls with the `-webkit-appearance` CSS property or the `::-webkit-foo` pseudo class selector. However the calendar popup does not provide such ways in WebKit because it is separate from the document, like a popup menu for `<select>`, and there is not currently a standard for how to control styling on its sub-elements.

### How do I avoid conflicts between the jQuery Datepicker and the native date picker?

If you have tried jQuery Datepicker on `input[type=date]` in Google Chrome, you might have noticed overlapping calendars of both the jQuery UI and the native calendar popup.
If you'd like to apply jQuery Datepicker on all platforms, use `input[type=text]` instead of `input[type=date]`. Not only Google Chrome but also iOS Safari, the BlackBerry browser, and Opera have their own UI for `input[type=date]`, and there is currently no way to achieve a unified UI on all platforms using `input[type=date]`.
If you'd like to apply jQuery Datepicker only on platforms without `input[type=date]` support, you may use [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/){: .external }, or the following code:


    var isDateInputSupported = function(){
    var elem = document.createElement('input');
    elem.setAttribute('type','date');
    elem.value = 'foo';
    return (elem.type == 'date' && elem.value != 'foo');
    }
    
    if (!isDateInputSupported())  // or.. !Modernizr.inputtypes.date
      $('input[type="date"]').datepicker();
