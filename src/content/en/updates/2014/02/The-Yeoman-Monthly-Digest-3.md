# The Yeoman Monthly Digest #3 {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/addyosmani.html" %}


Allo! Allo! This past month saw the Yeoman community grow to [472](http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html) generators. We’re excited to see so much passion for project scaffolding and are working on some new features to enable generators to extend and build on top of each other.

We’ll talk more about this soon, but for now here’s this month’s round-up of featured articles, generators and team blogs. We hope they’re useful!

## Until next time

If you’ve written an article, given a talk or created a generator you think would be useful to others, please feel free to share it with us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/yeoman) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/101063139999404044459/posts). We’re always interested in seeing how our tools are used.

Until the next time we run `yo digest`, happy scaffolding and don't be afraid - Yeoman is here to help, not replace you :D

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I’m genuinely scared that one day I’m going to be replaced by a <a href="https://twitter.com/yeoman">@yeoman</a> generator.</p>&mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/statuses/431764751610548225">February 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

*With thanks for the rest of the Yeoman team for their reviews*
