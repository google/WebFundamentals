# Blob support for IndexedDB landed on Chrome Dev {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/agektmr.html" %}


Chrome Dev has landed support for Blob on IndexedDB.

This is a long awaited feature for Chrome that allows IndexedDB API to be able to store and retrieve a Blob without converting it to a Base64 string.


IndexedDB provides large scale key-value type persistent storage that is available on most of modern browsers (Safari apparently will land support in iOS8 and Mac OS X 10.10). Check out [its implementation status](http://caniuse.com/#search=indexeddb).


Blob is a file-like binary object modern JavaScript engines can handle. File objects inherits from Blob. You can also fetch images and files as Blob via XMLHttpRequest. Check out [its implementation status](http://caniuse.com/#search=blob).


## Storing a Blob on IndexedDB
There is no way to feature detect the Blob availability in IndexedDB. You basically have to try-catch then use string instead of Blob if it is not available. Here's some sample code:


    // Create an example Blob object
    var blob = new Blob(['blob object'], {type: 'text/plain'});
    
    try {
        var store = db.transaction(['entries'], 'readwrite').objectStore('entries');
    
        // Store the object Â 
        var req = store.put(blob, 'blob');
        req.onerror = function(e) {
            console.log(e);
        };
        req.onsuccess = function(event) {
            console.log('Successfully stored a blob as Blob.');
        };
    } catch (e) {
        var reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = function(event) {
            // After exception, you have to start over from getting transaction.
            var store = db.transaction(['entries'], 'readwrite').objectStore('entries');
    
            // Obtain DataURL string
            var data = event.target.result;
            var req = store.put(data, 'blob');
            req.onerror = function(e) {
                console.log(e);
            };
            req.onsuccess = function(event) {
                console.log('Successfully stored a blob as String.');
            };
        };
        // Convert Blob into DataURL string
        reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
    }
    

Blob support for IndexedDB is already available on Firefox and Internet Explorer as well. Safari support needs to be investigated.


Enjoy!
