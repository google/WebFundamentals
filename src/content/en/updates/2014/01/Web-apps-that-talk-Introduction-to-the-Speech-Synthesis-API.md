# Web apps that talk - Introduction to the Speech Synthesis API {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/ericbidelman.html" %}

The [Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html) adds [voice recognition](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html#speechreco-section) (speech to text) and [speech synthesis](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html#tts-section) (text to speech) to JavaScript. The post briefly covers the latter, as the API recently landed in Chrome 33 (mobile and desktop). If you're interested in speech recognition, [Glen Shires](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/profiles/#glenshires) had a great writeup a while back on the voice recognition feature, "[Voice Driven Web Apps: Introduction to the Web Speech API](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API)".

## Basics

The most basic use of the synthesis API is to pass the `speechSynthesis.speak()` and utterance:


    var msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World');
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(msg);
    

However, you can also alter parameters to effect the volume, speech rate, pitch, voice, and language:


    var msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();
    var voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
    msg.voice = voices[10]; // Note: some voices don't support altering params
    msg.voiceURI = 'native';
    msg.volume = 1; // 0 to 1
    msg.rate = 1; // 0.1 to 10
    msg.pitch = 2; //0 to 2
    msg.text = 'Hello World';
    msg.lang = 'en-US';
    
    msg.onend = function(e) {
      console.log('Finished in ' + event.elapsedTime + ' seconds.');
    };
    
    speechSynthesis.speak(msg);
    

### Setting a voice

The API also allows you to get a list of voice the engine supports:


    speechSynthesis.getVoices().forEach(function(voice) {
      console.log(voice.name, voice.default ? voice.default :'');
    });
    

Then set a different voice, by setting `.voice` on the utterance object:


    var msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('I see dead people!');
    msg.voice = speechSynthesis.getVoices().filter(function(voice) { return voice.name == 'Whisper'; })[0];
    speechSynthesis.speak(msg);
    

Note: Depending on the platform, Chrome might have to be online for the speech synthesis to work. Examine the `localService` flag of the `voice` object to tell.

## Demo

In my Google I/O 2013 talk, "[More Awesome Web: features you've always wanted](http://www.moreawesomeweb.com/){: .external }" ([www.moreawesomeweb.com](http://www.moreawesomeweb.com/)), I showed a Google Now/Siri-like demo of using the Web Speech API's `SpeechRecognition` service with the Google Translate API to auto-translate microphone input into another language:


DEMO: [http://www.moreawesomeweb.com/demos/speech_translate.html](http://www.moreawesomeweb.com/demos/speech_translate.html)

Unfortunately, it used an undocumented (and unofficial API) to perform the speech synthesis. Well now we have the full Web Speech API to speak back the translation! I've updated the [demo](http://www.moreawesomeweb.com/demos/speech_translate.html) to use the synthesis API.

## Browser Support

Chrome 33 has full support for the Web Speech API, while Safari for iOS7 has partial support.

### Feature detection

Since browsers may support each portion of the Web Speech API separately (e.g. the case with Chromium), you may want to feature detect each feature separately:


    if ('speechSynthesis' in window) {
     // Synthesis support. Make your web apps talk!
    }
    
    if ('SpeechRecognition' in window) {
      // Speech recognition support. Talk to your apps!
    }
