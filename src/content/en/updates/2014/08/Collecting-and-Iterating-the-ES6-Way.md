# Collecting and Iterating, the ES6 Way {: .page-title }

The [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) 6 specification, while still in [draft form](http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html), brings the promise of many exciting new tools to add to the JavaScript programmer’s belt. New classes such as [Set](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-set-objects) and [Map](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-map-objects) offer native solutions to working with specific types of collections, and the [for...of](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-iteration-statements) statement provides an elegant alternative to traditional ways of iterating over data.

`Set`s offer a way of keeping track of a collection of items in which each item can appear at most once. `Map`s offer more functionality than was previously possible by using `Object`s to associate keys with values—with a `Map`, your keys don’t have to be strings, and you don’t have to worry about accidentally choosing a key name that clashes with an `Object`’s method names. Lookup operations on native `Map`s and `Set`s are done in [constant time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Constant_time), which offers efficiency gains over what’s possible with simulated implementations.

The [following sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/collections-iterators-es6/index.html) demonstrates constructing a `Set`, and using `for...of` to iterate over its elements:


    <pre id="log"></pre>
    
    <script>
      function log() {
        document.querySelector('#log').textContent += Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, '') + '\n';
      }
    
      log('Creating, using, and iterating over a Set:');
      var randomIntegers = new Set();
      // Generate a random integer in the range [1..10] five times,
      // and use a Set to keep track of the distinct integers that were generated.
      for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        randomIntegers.add(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1);
      }
      log(randomIntegers.size, ' distinct integers were generated.');
      log('The number 10 was ', randomIntegers.has(10) ? '' : 'not ', 'one of them.');
      log('Here\'s all of them:');
      // Use for...of to iterate over the items in the Set.
      // https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-iteration-statements
      // The Set iterator yields a single value corresponding to each entry in the Set.
      for (var item of randomIntegers) {
        log(item);
      }
    </script>
    

Here’s a [corresponding sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/collections-iterators-es6/index.html) that illustrates using and iterating over a `Map`:


    <script>
      log('\nCreating and iterating over a Map:');
      // Maps can be initialized by passing in an iterable value (https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-map-iterable)
      // Here, we use an Array of Arrays to initialize. The first value in each sub-Array is the new
      // Map entry's key, and the second is the item's value.
      var typesOfKeys = new Map([
        ['one', 'My key is a string.'],
        ['1', 'My key is also a string'],
        [1, 'My key is a number'],
        [document.querySelector('#log'), 'My key is an object']
      ]);
      // You can also call set() to add new keys/values to an existing Map.
      typesOfKeys.set('!!!!', 'My key is excited!');
    
      // Use for...of to iterate over the items in the Map.
      // https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-iteration-statements
      // There are several types of Map iterators available.
      // typesOfKeys.keys() can be used to iterate over just the keys:
      log('Just the keys:');
      for (var key of typesOfKeys.keys()) {
        log('  key: ', key);
      }
    
      // typesOfKeys.values() can be used to iterate over just the values:
      log('Just the values:');
      for (var value of typesOfKeys.values()) {
        log('  value: ', value);
      }
    
      // The default Map iterator yields an Array with two items; the first is the Map entry's key and the
      // second is the Map entry's value. This default iterator is equivalent to typesOfKeys.entries().
      log('Keys and values:');
      // Alternative, ES6-idiomatic syntax currently supported in Safari & Firefox:
      // for (var [key, value] of typesOfKeys) { … }
      for (var item of typesOfKeys) {
        log('  ', item[0], ' -> ', item[1]);
      }
    </script>
    

Some browsers, like [Chrome](http://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4818609708728320), [Internet Explorer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn263029), and [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) have already added support for `Set`s and `Map`s. Native support complemented by polyfill libraries like [es6-collections](https://github.com/WebReflection/es6-collections) or [es6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim/) means that JavaScript developers can start building with these new collection types today. There are no polyfills available for the `for...of` statement (though it is possible to transpile support via [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler)), but native support is available today in [Chrome](http://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4696563918045184) and [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).

**Update, September 2014**: Linked to an additional polyfill option, [es6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim/)
