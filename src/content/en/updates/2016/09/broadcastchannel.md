The [BroadcastChannel API][spec] allows same-origin scripts to send messages to other browsing contexts. It can be thought of as a simple message bus that allows pub/sub semantics between windows/tabs, iframes, web workers, and service workers.

## API basics

The Broadcast Channel API is a simple API that makes communicating between browsing contexts easier. That is, communicating between windows/tabs, iframes, web workers, and service workers. Messages which are posted to a given channel are delivered to all listeners of that channel.

The `BroadcastChannel` constructor takes a single parameter: the name of a channel.
The name identifies the channel and lives across browsing contexts.


    // Connect to the channel named "my_bus".
    const channel = new BroadcastChannel('my_bus');
    
    // Send a message on "my_bus".
    channel.postMessage('This is a test message.');
    
    // Listen for messages on "my_bus".
    channel.onmessage = function(e) {
      console.log('Received', e.data);
    };
    
    // Close the channel when you're done.
    channel.close();
    

### Sending messages

Messages can be strings or anything supported by the [structured clone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) algorithm (Strings, Objects, Arrays, Blobs, ArrayBuffer, Map).

*Example* - sending a Blob or File


    channel.postMessage(new Blob(['foo', 'bar'], {type: 'plain/text'}));
    

A channel won't broadcast to itself. So if you have an `onmessage` listener
on the same page as a `postMessage()` to the same channle, that `message` event
doesn't fire.

## Differences with other techniques

At this point you might be wondering how this relates to other techniques for message passing like WebSockets, SharedWorkers, the [`MessageChannel` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API), and `window.postMessage()`. The Broadcast Channel API doesn't replace these APIs. Each serves a purpose. The Broadcast Channel API is meant for easy one-to-many communication between scripts **on the same origin**.

Some use cases for broadcast channels:

- Detect user actions in other tabs
- Know when a user logs into an account in another window/tab.
- Instruct a worker to perform some background work
- Know when a service is done performing some action.
- When the user uploads a photo in one window, pass it around to other open pages.

**Example** - page that knows when the user logs out, even from another open tab on the same site:


    <button id="logout">Logout</button>
    
    <script>
    function doLogout() {
      // update the UI login state for this page.
    }
    
    const authChannel = new BroadcastChannel('auth');
    
    const button = document.querySelector('#logout');
    button.addEventListener('click', e => {
      // A channel won't broadcast to itself so we invoke doLogout()
      // manually on this page.
      doLogout();
      authChannel.postMessage({cmd: 'logout', user: 'Eric Bidelman'});
    });
    
    authChannel.onmessage = function(e) {
      if (e.data.cmd === 'logout') {
        doLogout();
      }
    };
    </script>
    

In another example, let's say you wanted to instruct a service worker to remove
cached content after the user changes their "offline storage setting" in your app.
You could delete their caches using `window.caches`, but the service worker may
already contain a utility to do this. We can use the Broadcast Channel API to
reuse that code! Without the Broadcast Channel API, you'd have to loop over the results of `self.clients.matchAll()` and call `postMessage()` on each client in order to achieve the communication from a service worker to all of its clients ([actual code that does that](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-toolbox/blob/master/lib/helpers.js#L114)). Using a Broadcast Channel makes this `O(1)` instead of `O(N)`.

**Example** - instruct a service worker to remove a cache, reusing its internal utility methods.


    // In index.html
    
    const channel = new BroadcastChannel('app-channel');
    channel.onmessage = function(e) {
      if (e.data.action === 'clearcache') {
        console.log('Cache removed:', e.data.removed);
      }
    };
    
    const messageChannel = new MessageChannel();
    
    // Send the service worker a message to clear the cache.
    // We can't use a BroadcastChannel for this because the
    // service worker may need to be woken up. MessageChannels do that.
    navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({
      action: 'clearcache',
      cacheName: 'v1-cache'
    }, [messageChannel.port2]);
    


    // In sw.js
    
    function nukeCache(cacheName) {
      return caches.delete(cacheName).then(removed => {
        // ...do more stuff (internal) to this service worker...
        return removed;
      });
    }
    
    self.onmessage = function(e) {
      const action = e.data.action;
      const cacheName = e.data.cacheName;
    
      if (action === 'clearcache') {
        nukeCache(cacheName).then(removed => {
          // Send the main page a response via the BroadcastChannel API.
          // We could also use e.ports[0].postMessage(), but the benefit
          // of responding with the BroadcastChannel API is that other
          // subscribers may be listening.
          const channel = new BroadcastChannel('app-channel');
          channel.postMessage({action, removed});
        });
      }
    };
    

### Difference with `postMessage()`

Unlike `postMessage()`, you no longer have to maintain a reference to an iframe or worker in order to communicate with it:


    // Don't have to save references to window objects.
    const popup = window.open('https://another-origin.com', ...);
    popup.postMessage('Sup popup!', 'https://another-origin.com');
    

`window.postMessage()` also allows you to communicate across origins. **The Broadcast Channel API is same-origin**. Since messages are guaranteed to come from the same origin, there's no need to validate them like we used to with `window.postMessage()`:


    // Don't have to validate the origin of a message.
    const iframe = document.querySelector('iframe');
    iframe.contentWindow.onmessage = function(e) {
      if (e.origin !== 'https://expected-origin.com') {
        return;
      }
      e.source.postMessage('Ack!', e.origin);
    };
    

Simply "subscribe" to particular channel and have secure, bidirectional communication!

### Difference with SharedWorkers

Use `BroadcastChannel` for simple cases where you need to send message to potentially several windows/tabs, or workers.

For fancier use cases like managing locks, shared state, synchronizing resources between a server and multiple clients, or sharing a WebSocket connection with a remote host, shared workers are the most appropriate solution.

### Difference with MessageChannel API

The main difference between the [Channel Messaging API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API) and `BroadcastChannel` is that the latter is a means to dispatch messages to multiple listeners (one-to-many). `MessageChannel` is meant for one-to-one communication directly between scripts. It's also more involved, requiring you to setup channels with a port on each end.

## Feature detection and browser support

Currently, Chrome 54, Firefox 38, and Opera 41 support the Broadcast Channel API.


    if ('BroadcastChannel' in self) {
      // BroadcastChannel API supported!
    }
    

As for polyfills, there are a few out there:

- [https://gist.github.com/alexis89x/041a8e20a9193f3c47fb](https://gist.github.com/alexis89x/041a8e20a9193f3c47fb)
- [https://gist.github.com/inexorabletash/52f437d1451d12145264](https://gist.github.com/inexorabletash/52f437d1451d12145264)

I haven't tried these, so your mileage may vary.
