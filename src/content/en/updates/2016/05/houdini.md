# Houdini: Demystifying CSS {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/surma.html" %}

Note: I have updated each section of this article with the
current state of the respective spec.

Have you ever thought about the amount of work CSS does? You change a single
attribute and suddenly your entire website appears in a different layout. It’s
kind of *magic* in that regard. (Can you tell where I am going with this?!) So
far, we – the community of web developers – have only been able to witness and
observe the magic. What if we want to come up with our own magic? What if we
want to *become the magician*? Enter Houdini!

The Houdini task force consists of engineers from Mozilla, Apple, Opera,
Microsoft, HP, Intel and Google working together to expose certain parts of the
CSS engine to web developers. The task force is working on a *collection of
drafts* with the goal to get them accepted by the W3C to become actual web
standards. They set themselves a few high-level goals, turned them into
specification drafts which in turn gave birth to a set of supporting,
lower-level specification drafts. The collection of these drafts is what is
usually meant when someone talks about “Houdini”. At the time of writing,
the [list of drafts][Houdini Drafts] is incomplete and some of the drafts
are mere placeholders. That’s how early in development of Houdini we are.

  </iframe>
</div>

Caution: I want to give a quick overview of the Houdini drafts so you have
an idea of what kind of problems Houdini tries to tackle. As far as the current
state of the specs allow, I’ll try to give code examples, as well. Please be
aware that all of these specs are *drafts* and very volatile. There’s no
guarantee that these code samples will be even remotely correct in the future or
that any of these drafts become reality.

## The specifications

### Worklets
([spec][Worklets spec])

Worklets by themselves are not really useful. They are a concept introduced to
make many of the later drafts possible. If you thought of Web Workers when you
read “worklet”, you are not wrong. They have a lot of conceptual overlap. So why
a new thing when we already have workers? Houdini’s goal is to expose new APIs
to allow web developers to hook up their own code into the CSS engine and the
surrounding systems. It’s probably not unrealistic to assume that some of these
code fragments will have to be run *every. single. frame*. Some of them have to
by definition. Quoting the [Web Worker spec]:

> Workers [...] are relatively heavy-weight, and are not intended to be used in
large numbers. For example, it would be inappropriate to launch one worker for
each pixel of a four megapixel image.

That means web workers are not viable for the things Houdini plans to do.
Therefore, worklets were invented. Worklets make use of ES2015 classes to define
a collection of methods, the signatures of which are predefined by
the type of the worklet. They are light-weight and short-lived.

### Paint worklet
([spec][Paint Worklet spec])

**Status update:** First incomplete implementation landed in Chrome Canary behind the
“Experimental Web Platform features” flag.

I am starting with this as it is introduces the fewest new concepts. From the
spec draft itself:

> The paint stage of CSS is responsible for painting the background, content and
highlight of an element based on that element’s geometry (as generated by the
layout stage) and computed style.

At the current level of the spec, you can create border
and background images dynamically. This allows you to do a lot of new things
like having a ripple effect on buttons without creating additional DOM elements.
Another big advantage of running your code at an element's paint time over
using a `<canvas>` element is that you will know the size of the element you are
painting and that you will be aware of the fragments and handle them appropriately.

Wait, what are fragments?

#### Fragments

I think of elements in the DOM tree as boxes that are laid out by the CSS engine
to make up my website. This model is flawed when inline elements come into play.
A `<span>` may need to be wrapped; so while still technically being a single DOM
node, it has been *fragmented* into 2, well, *fragments*. The [spec][Fragmentation spec]
calls the bounding box of these 2 fragments a *fragmentainer*. (I am not kidding.)

<img src="/web/updates/images/2016/05/houdini/fragment.png">

Back to the Paint Worklet: effectively, your code will get called for each
fragment and will be given access to a stripped down `<canvas>`-like API as well
as the styles applied to the element. Eventually, you  will even be able to request
an “overflow” margin to allow you to draw effects *around* the element’s boundaries,
just like `box-shadow`.


    class {
      static get inputProperties() {
        return ['border-color', 'border-size'];
      }
      paint(ctx, geom, inputProperties) {
        var offset = inputProperties['border-size']
        var colors = inputProperties['border-color'];
        self.drawFadingEdge(
          ctx,
          0-offset[0], 0-offset[0],
          geom.width+offset[0], 0-offset[0],
          color[0]);
        self.drawFadingEdge(
          ctx,
          geom.width+offset[1], 0-offset[1],
          geom.width+offset[1], geom.height+offset[1],
          color[1]);
        self.drawFadingEdge(
          ctx, 0-offset[2],
          geom.height+offset[2], geom.width+offset[2],
          geom.height+offset[2],
          color[2]);
        self.drawFadingEdge(
          ctx,
          0-offset[3], 0-offset[3],
          0-offset[3], geom.height+offset[3],
          color[3]);
      }
      drawFadingEdge(ctx, x0, y0, x1, y1, color) {
        var gradient =
          ctx.createLinearGradient(x0, y0, x1, y1);
        gradient.addColorStop(0, color);
        var colorCopy = new ColorValue(color);
        colorCopy.opacity = 0;
        gradient.addColorStop(0.5, colorCopy);
        gradient.addColorStop(1, color);
      }
      overflow(inputProperties) {
        // Taking a wild guess here. The return type
        // of overflow() is currently specified
        // as `void`, lol.
        return {
          top: inputProperties['border-size'][0],
          right: inputProperties['border-size'][1],
          bottom: inputProperties['border-size'][2],
          left: inputProperties['border-size'][3],
        };
      }
    };


Here is a video of a ripple [implementation][Paint Worklet source] that uses
the Paint Worklet API ([Demo][Paint Worklet demo]).

</div>

### Compositor worklet

Note: The API described here is obsolete. Compositor worklet has
been redesigned and is now proposed as “Animation Worklet”. More details on the
current iteration of the API can be found
[here](https://dassur.ma/things/animworklet/).

Even though the compositor worklet spec has been moved to the WICG and will
be iterated on, it’s the one the specs that excites me the most. As you might know, some
operations are outsourced to the graphics card of your computer by the CSS
engine, although that is dependent on both your grapics card and your device in
general. A browser usually takes the DOM tree and, based on specific criteria,
decides to give some branches and subtrees their own [layer][HTML5Rocks layers].
These subtrees paint themselves onto it (maybe using a paint worklet in the
future). As a final step, all these individual, now painted, layers are stacked
and positioned on top of each other, respecting z-indices, 3D transforms and
such, to yield the final image that is visible on your screen. This process is
called “compositing” and is executed by the “compositor”. The advantage of this
process is that you don’t have to make *all* the elements repaint themselves
when the page scrolls a tiny bit. Instead, you can reuse the layers from the
previous frame and just re-run the compositor with the changed scroll position.
This makes things fast. This helps us reach 60fps. This makes [Paul Lewis]
happy.

<img src="/web/updates/images/2016/05/houdini/compworklet_small.png">

As the name suggests, the compositor worklet lets you hook into the compositor
and influence the way an element’s layer, which has already been painted, is
positioned and layered on top of the other layers. To get a little more
specific, you can tell the browser that you want to hook into the compositing
process for a certain DOM node and can request access to certain attributes like
scroll position, `transform` or `opacity`. This will force this element on to its
own layer and *on each frame* your code gets called. You can move your layer
by manipulating the layers transform and change its attributes (like `opacity`)
allowing you to do fancy-schmancy things at a whopping 60 fps. Here’s a *full*
implementation for parallax scrolling using the compositor worklet.


    // main.js
    window.compositorWorklet.import('worklet.js')
      .then(function() {
        var animator = new CompositorAnimator('parallax');
        animator.postMessage([
          new CompositorProxy($('.scroller'), ['scrollTop']),
          new CompositorProxy($('.parallax'), ['transform']),
        ]);
      });

    // worklet.js
    registerCompositorAnimator('parallax', class {
      tick(timestamp) {
        var t = self.parallax.transform;
        t.m42 = -0.1 * self.scroller.scrollTop;
        self.parallax.transform = t;
      }

      onmessage(e) {
        self.scroller = e.data[0];
        self.parallax = e.data[1];
      };
    });


My colleague Robert Flack has written a [polyfill][CompWorklet polyfill] for the
compositor worklet so you can give it a try – obviously with a much
higher performance impact.

### Layout worklet
([spec][Layout Worklet spec])

Note: First real spec draft has been been proposed. Implementation
is a good while away.

Again, the specification for this is practically empty, but the concept is
intriguing: write your own layout! The layout worklet is supposed to enable you
to do `display: layout('myLayout')` and run your JavaScript to arrange a node’s
children in the node’s box. Of course, running a full JavaScript implementation
of CSS’s `flex-box` layout will be slower than running an equivalent native
implementation, but it’s easy to imagine a scenario where cutting corners can
yield a performance gain. Imagine a website consisting of nothing but tiles á la
Windows 10 or a [Masonry]-style layout. Absolute/fixed positioning is not used,
neither is `z-index` nor do elements ever overlap or have any kind of border or
overflow. Being able to skip all these checks on re-layout could yield a
performance gain.


    registerLayout('random-layout', class {
        static get inputProperties() {
          return [];
        }
        static get childrenInputProperties() {
          return [];
        }
        layout(children, constraintSpace, styleMap) {
            Const width = constraintSpace.width;
            Const height =constraintSpace.height;
            for (let child of children) {
                const x = Math.random()*width;
                const y = Math.random()*height;
                const constraintSubSpace = new ConstraintSpace();
                constraintSubSpace.width = width-x;
                constraintSubSpace.height = height-y;
                const childFragment = child.doLayout(constraintSubSpace);
                childFragment.x = x;
                childFragment.y = y;
            }

            return {
                minContent: 0,
                maxContent: 0,
                width: width,
                height: height,
                fragments: [],
                unPositionedChildren: [],
                breakToken: null
            };
        }
    });


### Typed CSSOM
([spec][Typed CSSOM spec])

Note: An “almost complete” implementation has landed in Chrome Canary
behind the “Experimental Web Platform features” flag.

Typed CSSOM (CSS Object Model or Cascading Style Sheets Object Model) addresses a
problem we probably all have encountered and just learned to just put up with.
Let me illustrate with a line of JavaScript:


    $('#someDiv').style.height = getRandomInt() + 'px';


We are doing math, converting a number to a string to append a unit just to have
the browser parse that string and convert it back to a number for the CSS engine.
This gets even uglier when you [manipulate transforms with JavaScript][Aerotwist FLIP].
No more! CSS is about to get some typing!

This draft is one of the more mature ones and a [polyfill][Typed CSSOM polyfill] is
already being worked on. (Disclaimer: using the polyfill will obviously
add *even more* computational overhead. The point is to show how convenient the
API is.)

Instead of strings you will be working on an element’s `StylePropertyMap`, where
each CSS attribute has it’s own key and corresponding value type. Attributes
like `width` have `LengthValue` as their value type. A `LengthValue` is a
dictionary of all CSS units like `em`, `rem`, `px`, `percent`, etc. Setting
`height: calc(5px + 5%)` would yield a `LengthValue{px: 5, percent: 5}`. Some
properties like `box-sizing` just accept certain keywords and therefore have a
`KeywordValue` value type. The validity of those attributes could then be checked
at runtime.


    <div style="width: 200px;" id="div1"></div>
    <div style="width: 300px;" id="div2"></div>
    <div id="div3"></div>
    <div style="margin-left: calc(5em + 50%);" id="div4"></div>
    var w1 = $('#div1').styleMap.get('width');
    var w2 = $('#div2').styleMap.get('width');
    $('#div3').styleMap.set('background-size',
      [new SimpleLength(200, 'px'), w1.add(w2)])
    $('#div4')).styleMap.get('margin-left')
      // => {em: 5, percent: 50}


### Properties and values
([spec][Properties and Values spec])

Note: Spec is pretty stable. No accesible implementation as of yet.

Do you know [CSS Custom Properties] (or their unofficial alias “CSS Variables”)?
This is them but with types! So far, variables could only have string values and
used a simple search-and-replace approach. This draft would allow you to not
only specify a type for your variables, but also define a default value and
influence the inheritance behavior using a JavaScript API. Technically, this
would also allow custom properties to get animated with standard CSS transitions
and animations, which is also being considered.


    ["--scale-x", "--scale-y"].forEach(function(name) {
    document.registerProperty({
        name: name,
        syntax: "<number>",
        inherits: false,
        initialValue: "1"
      });
    });


### Font metrics

Font metrics is exactly what it sounds like. What is the bounding box (or the
bounding boxes when we are wrapping) when I render string X with font Y at size
Z? What if I go all crazy unicode on you like using [ruby annotations]? This has
been requested a lot and Houdini should finally make these wishes
come true.

### But wait, there’s more!

There’s even more specs in Houdini’s list of drafts, but the future of those is
rather uncertain and they are not much more than placeholders for ideas.
Examples include custom overflow behaviors, CSS syntax extension API, extension
of native scroll behavior and similarly ambitious things all of which enable
things on the web platform that weren't possible before.

## Demos

I have open-sourced the [code for the demo][Houdini Samples]
([live demo][Houdini Demo] using polyfill) videos I made so you can get a feeling
on what working with worklets feels like. I will update the repository with new
demos as new APIs are landing in Canary.

If you want to get involved, there’s always the [Houdini mailing list].
