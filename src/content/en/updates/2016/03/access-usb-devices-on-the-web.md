# Access USB Devices on the Web {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/beaufortfrancois.html" %}



If I said plain and simple "USB", there is a good chance that you will
immediately think of keyboards, mice, audio, video and storage devices. You're
right but you'll find other kinds of Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices out
there.

These non-standardized USB devices require hardware vendors to write native
drivers and SDKs in order for you (the developer) to take advantage of them.
Sadly this native code has historically prevented these devices from being used
by the Web. And that's one of the reasons the WebUSB API has been created: to
provide a way to expose USB device services to the Web. With this API, hardware
manufacturers will be able to build cross-platform JavaScript SDKs for their
devices.
But most importantly this will **make USB safer and easier to use by bringing
it to the Web**.

Let's see what you could expect with the WebUSB API:

1. Buy a USB device.
2. Plug it into your computer.
3. A notification appears right away, with the right website to go to for this device.
4. Simply click on it. Website is there and ready to use!
5. Click to connect and a USB device chooser shows up in Chrome, where you can pick your device.
6. Tada!

What would this procedure be like without the WebUSB API?

- Read a box, label, or search on line and possibly end up on the wrong website.
- Have to install a native application.
- Is it supported on my operating system? Make sure you download the "right" thing.
- Scary OS prompts popup and warn you about installing drivers/applications from the Internet.
- Malfunctioning code harms the whole computer. The Web is built to [contain malfunctioning websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29e0CtgXZSI).
- Only use the USB device once? On the Web, the website is gone once you closed tab. On a computer the code sticks around.

## Before we start

This article assumes you have some basic knowledge of how USB works. If not, I
recommend reading [USB in a NutShell](http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell).
For background information about USB, check out the [official USB
specifications](http://www.usb.org/home).

The [WebUSB API](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/){: .external } is currently a
draft which means that it is far enough along to be real and usable, but there
is still time to make fixes that developers need. That's why the Chrome Team is
actively looking for eager developers to try it and give
[feedback on the spec](https://github.com/wicg/webusb/issues) and
[feedback on the implementation](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?components=Blink%3EUSB).

In the very near future we plan for you to be able to enable WebUSB on your
origin via [Origin Trials](#available_for_origin_trials). Until then you can
enable it on your local computer for development purposes by flipping an
experimental flag. The implementation is partially complete and currently
available on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, and Windows. Go to
`chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`, enable the
highlighted flag, restart Chrome and you should be good to go.

<img style="width:723px; max-height:205px" src="/web/updates/images/2016-03-02-access-usb-devices-on-the-web/web-usb-flag.png" alt="Web USB Flag highlighted in chrome://flags"/>

### Available for Origin Trials

In order to get as much feedback as possible from developers using the WebUSB
API in the field, we will also add this feature in Chrome 54 as an
[origin trial](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials) for Chrome
OS, Linux, Mac, and Windows. During the origin trial, the API may still change in
backward-incompatible ways before we freeze it into the web platform.  To use
this experimental API in Chrome with no flag, you'll need to [request a token
for your origin](http://bit.ly/WebUSBOriginTrial) and [insert it in your
application](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md).

The trial will end in March 2017. By that point, we expect to have figured
out any changes necessary to stabilize the feature and move it out from Origin
Trials.

## Privacy and security

To understand what WebUSB is and isn't, I recommend the [WebUSB Security
Model](https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-webusb-security-model-f48ee04de0ab)
post from Reilly Grant, a software engineer on the Chrome team, working on
the WebUSB API specification.

### Attacks against USB devices

The WebUSB API does not even try to provide a way for a web page to connect to
arbitrary USB devices. There are plenty of published attacks against USB
devices that makes it unsafe to allow this.

For this reason, a USB device can define a set of origins that are allowed to
connect to it. This is similar to the
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)
mechanism in HTTP. In other words, **WebUSB devices are associated with a web
origin** and can only be accessed from a page from the same origin.

Hardware manufacturers will have to update the firmware in their USB devices in order
to enable WebUSB access to their device via the [Platform Capability
descriptor](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/#webusb-platform-capability-descriptor).
Later a [Public Device Registry](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/#public-device-registry) 
will be created so that hardware manufacturers can support WebUSB on existing
devices.

### HTTPS only

Because this experimental API is a powerful new feature added to the Web,
Chrome aims to make it available only to [secure
contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/#intro). This
means you'll need to build with TLS in mind.

Note: We care deeply about security, so you will notice that new Web capabilities require HTTPS. The WebUSB API is no different, and is yet another good reason to get HTTPS up and running on your site.

During development you'll be able to interact with WebUSB through
`http://localhost` by using tools like the [Chrome Dev
Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg)
or the handy `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, but to deploy it on a site you'll
need to have HTTPS set up on your server. I personally enjoy [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com) for demo purposes.

To add HTTPS to your server you'll need to get a TLS certificate and set
it up. Be sure to check out the [Security with HTTPS
article](/web/fundamentals/security/)
for best practices there. For info, you can now get free TLS certificates with
the new Certificate Authority [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){: .external }.

### User gesture required

As a security feature, getting access to connected USB devices with
`navigator.usb.requestDevice` must be called via a user gesture
like a touch or mouse click.

## Let's start coding

The WebUSB API relies heavily on JavaScript
[Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
If you're not familiar with them, check out this great
[Promises tutorial](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises). One
more thing, `() => {}` are simply ECMAScript 2015 [Arrow
functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
-- they have a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically
bind the value of `this`.

### Get access to USB devices

You can either prompt the user to select a single connected USB device using
`navigator.usb.requestDevice` or call `navigator.usb.getDevices` to get a list
of all connected USB devices the origin has access to.

The `navigator.usb.requestDevice` function takes a mandatory JavaScript object
that defines `filters`. These filters are used to match any USB device with the
given vendor (`vendorId`) and optionally product (`productId`) identifiers. The
`classCode`, `subclassCode` and `protocolCode` keys can also be defined there
as well.

<img style="width:723px; max-height:414px" src="/web/updates/images/2016-03-02-access-usb-devices-on-the-web/usb-device-chooser.png" alt="USB Device Chooser screenshot"/>

For instance, here's how to get access to a connected Arduino device configured
to allow the origin.


    navigator.usb.requestDevice({ filters: [{ vendorId: 0x2341 }] })
    .then(device => {
      console.log(device.productName);      // "Arduino Micro"
      console.log(device.manufacturerName); // "Arduino LLC"
    })
    .catch(error => { console.log(error); });
    

Before you ask, I didn't magically come up with this `0x2341` hexadecimal
number. I simply searched for the word "Arduino" in this [List of USB
ID's](http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids).

The USB `device` returned in the fulfilled promise above has some basic, yet
important information about the device such as the supported USB version,
maximum packet size, vendor and product IDs, the number of possible
configurations the device can have - basically all fields contained in the
[device USB Descriptor](http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb5.shtml#DeviceDescriptors)

For info, if a USB device announces its [support for WebUSB](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/#webusb-platform-capability-descriptor),
as well as defining a landing page URL, Chrome will show a persistent
notification when the USB device is plugged in. Clicking on this notification
will open the landing page.

<img style="width:723px; max-height:345px" src="/web/updates/images/2016-03-02-access-usb-devices-on-the-web/web-usb-notification.png" alt="WebUSB notification"/>

From there, you can simply call `navigator.usb.getDevices` and get access to
your Arduino device as shown below.


    navigator.usb.getDevices().then(devices => {
      devices.map(device => {
        console.log(device.productName);      // "Arduino Micro"
        console.log(device.manufacturerName); // "Arduino LLC"
      });
    })
    

### Talk to an Arduino USB board

Okay, now let's see how easy it is to communicate from a WebUSB compatible
Arduino board over the USB port. Check out instructions at
[https://github.com/webusb/arduino](https://github.com/webusb/arduino) to
WebUSB-enable your [sketches](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sketch).

Don't worry, I'll cover all the WebUSB device methods mentioned below later in
this article.


    var device;
    
    navigator.usb.requestDevice({ filters: [{ vendorId: 0x2341 }] })
    .then(selectedDevice => {
       device = selectedDevice;
       return device.open(); // Begin a session.
     })
    .then(() => device.selectConfiguration(1)) // Select configuration #1 for the device.
    .then(() => device.claimInterface(2)) // Request exclusive control over interface #2.
    .then(() => device.controlTransferOut({
        requestType: 'class',
        recipient: 'interface',
        request: 0x22,
        value: 0x01,
        index: 0x02})) // Ready to receive data
    .then(() => device.transferIn(5, 64)) // Waiting for 64 bytes of data from endpoint #5.
    .then(result => {
      let decoder = new TextDecoder();
      console.log('Received: ' + decoder.decode(result.data));
    })
    .catch(error => { console.log(error); });
    

Please keep in mind that the WebUSB library we are using here is just
implementing one example protocol (based on the standard USB serial protocol)
and that manufacturers can create any set and types of endpoints they
wish. Control transfers are especially nice for small configuration commands as
they get bus priority and have a well defined structure.

And here's the sketch that has been uploaded to the Arduino board.


    // Third-party WebUSB Arduino library
    #include <WebUSB.h>
    
    const WebUSBURL URLS[] = {
      { 1, "webusb.github.io/arduino/demos/" },
      { 0, "localhost:8000" },
    };
    
    const uint8_t ALLOWED_ORIGINS[] = { 1, 2 };
    
    WebUSB WebUSBSerial(URLS, 2, 1, ALLOWED_ORIGINS, 2);
    
    #define Serial WebUSBSerial
    
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);
      while (!Serial) {
        ; // Wait for serial port to connect.
      }
      Serial.write("WebUSB FTW!");
      Serial.flush();
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // Nothing here for now.
    }
    

The third-party [WebUSB Arduino
library](https://github.com/webusb/arduino/tree/gh-pages/library/WebUSB) used
in the sample code above does basically two things:

- The device acts as a WebUSB device enabling Chrome to read
  the [landing page URL](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/#webusb-platform-capability-descriptor)
  and the [list of origins](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/#get-allowed-origins) allowed to communicate with.
- It exposes a WebUSB Serial API that you may use to override the default one.

Let's look at the JavaScript code again. Once we get the `device` picked by the
user, `device.open` simply runs all platform-specific steps to start a session
with the USB device. Then, we have to select an available USB Configuration
with `device.selectConfiguration`. Remember that a Configuration specifies how
the device is powered, its maximum power consumption and its number of
interfaces. Talking about interfaces, we also need to request exclusive access
with `device.claimInterface` since data can only be transferred to an interface
or associated endpoints when the interface is claimed. Finally calling
`device.controlTransferOut` is needed to set up the Arduino device with the
appropriate commands to communicate through the WebUSB Serial API.

From there, `device.transferIn` performs a bulk transfer onto the
device to inform it that the host is ready to receive bulk data. Then, the
promise is fulfilled with a `result` object containing a
[DataView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView)
`data` that has to be parsed appropriately.

For those who are familiar with USB, all of this should look pretty familiar.

### I want moar

The WebUSB API lets you interact with the all USB transfer/endpoint types:

- CONTROL transfers, used to send or receive configuration or command
  parameters to a USB device are handled with `controlTransferIn(setup,
  length)` and `controlTransferOut(setup, data)`.
- INTERRUPT transfers, used for a small amount of time sensitive data are
  handled with the same methods as BULK transfers with
  `transferIn(endpointNumber, length)` and `transferOut(endpointNumber, data)`.
- ISOCHRONOUS transfers, used for streams of data like video and sound are
  handled with `isochronousTransferIn(endpointNumber, packetLengths)` and
 `isochronousTransferOut(endpointNumber, data, packetLengths)`.
- BULK transfers, used to transfer a large amount of non-time-sensitive data in
  a reliable way are handled with `transferIn(endpointNumber, length)` and
 `transferOut(endpointNumber, data)`.

You may also want to have a look at Mike Tsao's [WebLight
project](https://github.com/sowbug/weblight) which provides a ground-up example
of building a USB-controlled LED device designed for the WebUSB API (not using
an Arduino here). You'll find hardware, software, and firmware.

## Tips

Debugging USB in Chrome is easier with the internal page `chrome://device-log`
where you can see all USB device related events in one single place.

<img style="width:723px; max-height:414px" src="/web/updates/images/2016-03-02-access-usb-devices-on-the-web/web-usb-device-log-page.png" alt="Internal page to debug Web USB"/>

Early adopters who want to test their existing devices with WebUSB before they
update their firmware or the [Public Device Registry](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/#public-device-registry) 
is [implemented](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=598765) 
are not out of luck thanks to a dedicated switch. To disable checking of
the WebUSB allowed origins descriptors that implement a CORS-like mechanism to
secure origin to device communications, run `chrome` with the
`--disable-webusb-security` [switch](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags).

On most Linux systems, USB devices are mapped with read-only permissions by
default. To allow Chrome to open a USB device, you will need to add a new [udev rule](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udev.html).
Create a file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-yourdevicename.rules` with the following
content:


    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="[yourdevicevendor]", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"


where `[yourdevicevendor]` is `2341` if your device is an Arduino for instance.
`ATTR{idProduct}` can also be added for a more specific rule. Make sure your
`user` is a member of the `plugdev` group.  Then, just reconnect your device.

## What's next

At the time of writing, Chrome implementation of WebUSB works already on Chrome
OS, Android L, Linux, Mac OSX and Windows 7.

Note: Microsoft OS 2.0 Descriptors used by the Arduino examples only work on Windows 8.1 and later. Without that Windows support still requires manual installation of an INF file.

A second iteration of the WebUSB API will look at [Shared Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker)
and [Service Worker](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/resources.html)
support. Imagine for instance a security key website using the WebUSB API that
would install a service worker to act as a middle man to authenticate users.

And for your greatest pleasure, the WebUSB API is already available now on
Android in Chrome 54.
