[Progressive Web Apps][PWAs] enable developers to build a new class of
applications that deliver reliable, high performance user experiences.
But to be sure a web app is achieving its desired performance goals,
developers need access to high resolution performance measurement
data. The [W3C Performance Timeline specification][spec] defines such
an interface for browsers to provide programmatic access to low level
timing data. This opens the door to some interesting use cases:

* offline and custom performance analysis
* third party performance analysis and visualization tools
* performance assessment integrated into IDEs and other developer tools

Access to this kind of timing data is already available in most major
browsers for [navigation timing][navigation], [resource timing][resource],
and [user timing][user]. 
The newest addition is the [performance observer][perf observer]
interface, which is essentially a streaming interface to gather low level
timing information asynchronously, as it's gathered by the browser.
This new interface provides a number of critical advantages over previous
methods to access the timeline:

* Today, apps have to periodically poll and diff the stored measurements,
which is costly. This interface offers them a callback. (In other words,
there is no need to poll). As a result apps using this API can be more
responsive and more efficient.
* It’s not subject to buffer limits (most buffers are set to 150 items
by default), and avoids race conditions between different consumers that
may want to modify the buffer.
* Performance observer notifications are delivered asynchronously and
the browser can dispatch them during idle time to avoid competing with
critical rendering work.

*Beginning in Chrome 52, the performance observer interface is
enabled by default*. Let’s take a look at how to use it.


    <html>
    <head>
      <script>
        var observer = new PerformanceObserver(list => {
          list.getEntries().forEach(entry => {
            // Display each reported measurement on console
            if (console) {
              console.log("Name: "       + entry.name      +
                          ", Type: "     + entry.entryType +
                          ", Start: "    + entry.startTime +
                          ", Duration: " + entry.duration  + "\n");
            }
          })
        });
        observer.observe({entryTypes: ['resource', 'mark', 'measure']});
        performance.mark('registered-observer');
    
        function clicked(elem) {
          performance.measure('button clicked');
        }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <button onclick="clicked(this)">Measure</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    

This simple page starts with a script tag defining some JavaScript code:

* We instantiate a new `PerformanceObserver` object and pass an event
handler function to the object constructor. The constructor initializes
the object such that our handler will be called every time a new set
of measurement data is ready to be processed (with the measurement
data passed as a list of objects). The handler is defined here as an
anonymous function that simply displays the formatted measurement data
on the console. In a real world scenario, this data might be stored
in the cloud for subsequent analysis, or piped into an interactive
visualization tool.
* We register for the [types of timing events][types] we’re interested
in via the `observe()` method and call the [`mark()`][mark] method
to mark the instant at which we registered, which we’ll consider the
beginning of our timing intervals.
* We define a click handler for a button defined in the page body. This
click handler calls the [`measure()`][measure] method to capture timing data
about when the button was clicked.

In the body of the page, we define a button, assign our click handler to
the `onclick` event, and we’re ready to go.

Now, if we load the page and open the Chrome DevTools
panel to watch the JavaScript console, every time we click the button a
performance measurement is taken. *And because we’ve registered to observe
such measurements, they are forwarded to our event handler, asynchronously
without the need to poll the timeline*, which displays the measurements
on the console as they occur:

The `start` value represents the starting timestamp for events of type
`mark` (of which this app has only one). Events with type `measure` have
no inherent starting time; they represent timing measurements taken
relative to the last `mark` event. Thus, the duration values seen here
represent the elapsed time between the call to `mark()`, which serves
as a common interval starting point, and multiple subsequent calls to
`measure()`.

As you can see, this API is quite simple and it offers the ability to gather
filtered, high resolution, real time performance data without polling, which
should open the door to more efficient performance tooling for web apps.
