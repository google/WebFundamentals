# Bringing Easy and Fast Checkout with Payment Request API {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/agektmr.html" %}



It's no surprise that the majority of online shopping is happening on mobile
devices these days. But did you know that 66% of mobile purchases are made
through websites rather than apps?  Unfortunately though, conversion rate on
mobile websites is only 33% of that on desktop. We need to fix this.

Chrome 53 for Android (desktop to be supported in the future) introduces a new
API called [Payment Request](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/) - a new
approach for developers to eliminate checkout forms and improve user's payment
experience from the ground up.

## Introducing Payment Request API

Payment Request is a new API for the open web that makes checkout flows easier,
faster and consistent on shopping sites.

* Provides a native user interface for users to select or add a payment method,
  a shipping address and a shipping option in an easy, fast and consistent way.
* Provides standardized imperative APIs for developers to obtain user's payment
  preferences in a consistent format.


## How the Payment Request API works

Let's peek at how Payment Request API works in some code. Here's a minimal
example that collects a user's credit card information and submits it to a
server.


    function onBuyClicked() {
      if (!window.PaymentRequest) {
        // PaymentRequest API is not available. Forwarding to
        // legacy form based experience.
        location.href = '/checkout';
        return;
      }

      // Supported payment methods
      var supportedInstruments = [{
          supportedMethods: ['basic-card']
          data: {
            supportedNetworks: [
              'visa', 'mastercard', 'amex', 'discover',
              'diners', 'jcb', 'unionpay'
            ]
          }
      }];

      // Checkout details
      var details = {
        displayItems: [{
          label: 'Original donation amount',
          amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '65.00' }
        }, {
          label: 'Friends and family discount',
          amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '-10.00' }
        }],
        total: {
          label: 'Total due',
          amount: { currency: 'USD', value : '55.00' }
        }
      };

      // 1. Create a `PaymentRequest` instance
      var request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details);

      // 2. Show the native UI with `.show()`
      request.show()
      // 3. Process the payment
      .then(result => {
        // POST the payment information to the server
        return fetch('/pay', {
          method: 'POST',
          credentials: 'include',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(result.toJSON())
        }).then(response => {
          // 4. Display payment results
          if (response.status === 200) {
            // Payment successful
            return result.complete('success');
          } else {
            // Payment failure
            return result.complete('fail');
          }
        }).catch(() => {
          return result.complete('fail');
        });
      });
    }

    document.querySelector('#start').addEventListener('click', onBuyClicked);

### 1. Create a PaymentRequest instance

When a  user taps on "Checkout", start a payment procedure by instantiating
`PaymentRequest`.


      var request = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details);


### 2. Show the native UI with .show()

Show the native payment UI with `show()`. Within this UI, a user can determine a
payment method already stored in the browser or add a new one.


      request.show()
      .then(payment => {
        // pressed "Pay"
      });

 <img src="/web/updates/images/2016/07/payment-request/3.png" style="max-width:340px">

### 3. Process the payment

Upon user tapping on "PAY" button, a promise will be resolved and payment
information will be passed to the resolving function. You can send the
information either to your own server, or send it through a third party like
Stripe for processing.


      request.show()
      .then(result => {
        // POST the payment information to the server
        return fetch('/pay', {
          method: 'POST',
          credentials: 'include',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(result.toJSON())
        }).then(response => {
          // Examine server response
          if (response.status === 200) {
            // Payment successful
            return result.complete('success');
          } else {
            // Payment failure
            return result.complete('fail');
          }
        }).catch(() => {
          return result.complete('fail');
        });
      });

 <img src="/web/updates/images/2016/07/payment-request/5.png" style="max-width:340px">

### 4. Display payment results

If the payment verification was successful, call `.complete('success')` to
complete the purchase, otherwise `.complete('fail')`. Success / failure status
will be displayed using a native UI. Upon resolving the `.complete()`, you can
proceed to the next step.

## Payment Request API can do more

### Shipping items

If you are selling physical goods, you'll probably need to collect the user's
shipping address and a shipping preference such as "Free shipping" or "Express
shipping". Payment Request API certainly supports those use cases. See [the
integration guide](/web/fundamentals/primers/payment-request/) to learn more.

### Adding more payment solutions

Credit card is not the only supported payment solution for Payment Request.
There are a number of other payment services and solutions in the wild and the
Payment Request API is designed to support as many of those as possible. Google
is working to bring [Android Pay to
Chrome](/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/android-pay).
Other third party solutions will be supported in the near future as well. Stay
tuned for updates.

## FAQ

### Are there any restrictions to using the API?

Use Chrome for Android with version 53 or later. Requires secure origin - HTTPS,
localhost or file:///.

### Is it possible to query the available payment methods?

Currently not supported, but we're investigating ways of exposing this API in a
privacy-sensitive way. Payment Request API is designed to support the broadest
possible array of payment methods. Each payment method is identified by a
[payment method
identifier](https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/specs/architecture.html#dfn-payment-method-identifier).
Payment Method Identifiers will support distributed extensibility, meaning that
there does not need to be a central machine-readable registry to discover or
register [payment
methods](https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/specs/architecture.html#dfn-payment-method).

### Do you plan on offering a coupon code?

We are investigating how to best do this. For now, you can manually ask for
a coupon code before or after calling the API.

### Does this work with iframes?

Starting with Chrome 57, using the Payment Request API inside an `iframe` is
supported. Simply add `allowpaymentrequest` attribute to allow the `iframe` to
use the API.

    <iframe src="URL_INCLUDING_PAYMENT_REQUEST_CALL" allowpaymentrequest></iframe>

### Are there any polyfills available to support incompatible browsers for this API?

Not currently.

### Can I assume the current API is final?

It could change. We provide [a
shim](https://storage.googleapis.com/prshim/v1/payment-shim.js) that protects
you from API changes that may be backwards incompatible. By embedding the shim
in your website, it will paper over any API differences for two major Chrome
versions.
