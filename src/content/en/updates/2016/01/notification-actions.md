Early in 2015 we introduced Push Messaging and Notification in to Chrome for 
Android and Desktop.  It was a great step forward on the web.  Users could start 
to engage more deeply with experiences on the web even when the browser was 
closed.

Whilst it is great that you can send these messages, the only thing you could do 
with one was either to click it and open a page or dismiss it entirely.

If you look at the notifications provided natively to apps on mobile platforms 
such as iOS and Android, they each let the developer define contextual actions 
that the user can invoke and interact with.  In Chrome 48 we have now added a 
similar ability to [Web 
Notifications](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5906566364528640) across 
Desktop and Chrome for Android.

The addition to the API is pretty simple.  You just need to create an Array of 
actions and add them into the `NotificationOptions` object when you call 
`showNotification` from a ServiceWorker registration (either directly in the 
ServiceWorker or on a page via `navigator.serviceWorker.ready`).

Currently Chrome only supports [two actions on each 
notification](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/content/common/notification_constants.h&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=13&rcl=1454286458). 
Some platforms might be able to support more, and some platforms may support 
less or none at all.  You can determine what the platform supports by checking 
`Notification.maxActions`. In the following examples we are assuming the platform 
supports two actions.


    self.registration.showNotification('New message from Alice', {  
      actions: [  
       {action: 'like', title: 'Like'},  
       {action: 'reply', title: 'Reply'}]  
    });
    

This will create a simple notification with two buttons.  Note, it is not 
possible to add icons to the action directly 
([yet](https://github.com/whatwg/notifications/issues/59)), but you can use 
Emoji and the extended Unicode character set to add more context to your 
notifications buttons.

For example: 


    self.registration.showNotification("New message from Alice", {  
      actions: [  
       {action: 'like', title: 'üëçLike'},  
       {action: 'reply', title: '‚§ª Reply'}]  
    });
    

Now that you have created a notification and made it look üòª, the user may 
interact with the notification at some time in the future.  Interactions with 
the notification all currently (as of Chrome 48) come through the 
`notificationclick` event registered in your service worker and they can either be 
a general click on the notification or a specific tap on one of the action 
buttons.  Side note, in the future you will also be able to [respond to the 
](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5706570994286592)[notificationclose](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5706570994286592)[ 
event](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5706570994286592).

To understand which action the user took you need to inspect the `action` property 
on the event and then you have the choice of either opening a new page for the 
user to complete an action or to perform the task in the background.


    self.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {  
      var messageId = event.notification.data;
    
      event.notification.close();  
        
      if (event.action === 'like') {  
        silentlyLikeItem();  
      }  
      else if (event.action === 'reply') {  
        clients.openWindow("/messages?reply=" + messageId);  
      }  
      else {  
        clients.openWindow("/messages?reply=" + messageId);  
      }  
    }, false);
    

The interesting thing is that the actions don't have to open up a new window, 
they can perform general application interactions without creating a user 
interface.  For example, a user could "Like" or "Delete" a social media post 
that would perform the action on the user's local data and then synchronize it 
with the cloud without opening a UI (although it is good practice to message the 
data change to any open windows so the UI can be updated). For an 
action that requires user interaction you would open a window for the user to 
reply. 

Because platforms will not support the same number of actions, or in some cases 
not be able to support Notification Action buttons at all, you will need to ensure 
that you always provide a sensible fallback to a task that is what you would expect
the user to do if they were to just click the notification.
