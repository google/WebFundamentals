# Avoiding the Not Secure Warning in Chrome {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/ericlawrence.html" %}

As [announced in September](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html),
Chrome will soon mark non-secure pages containing **password** and **credit
card** input fields as **Not Secure** in the URL bar.

This document is intended to aid Web Developers in updating their sites to avoid
this warning.

## Enable warnings

Warnings will be enabled by default for everyone in Chrome 56, slated for
release in January 2017.

To test the upcoming user experience before that time, install the latest 
[Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) build.

To configure Chrome to show the warning as it will appear in January 2017, open
`chrome://flags/#mark-non-secure-as` and set the `Mark non-secure origins as
non-secure` option to `Display a verbose state when password or credit card
fields are detected on an HTTP page`. Then relaunch your browser.

You can see an example of the browserâ€™s warning behavior on
[this page](http://http-password.badssl.com/).

When the Not Secure state is shown, the DevTools console shows the message `This
page includes a password or credit card input in a non-secure context. A warning
has been added to the URL bar.`

## Resolve warnings

To ensure that the Not Secure warning is not displayed for your pages, you must
ensure that all forms containing `<input type=password>` elements and any inputs
detected as [credit card
fields](/web/updates/2015/06/checkout-faster-with-autofill) are present _only_
on secure origins. This means that the top-level page must be HTTPS and, if the
`input` is in an iframe, that iframe must also be served over HTTPS.

Warning: It is **NOT** sufficient to place an HTTPS iframe inside a HTTP page; the
top-level page itself must be HTTPS as well.

If your site overlays an HTTPS login frame over HTTP pages...

...you will need to change the site to either use HTTPS for the entire site
(ideal) or redirect the browser window to an HTTPS page containing the login
form:

## Long term - Use HTTPS everywhere

Eventually, Chrome will show a Not Secure warning for _all_ pages served over
HTTP, regardless of whether or not the page contains sensitive input fields.
Even if you adopt one of the more targeted resolutions above, you should plan to
migrate your site to use HTTPS for all pages.
