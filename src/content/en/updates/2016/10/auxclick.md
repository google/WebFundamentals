When is a click not a `click`? For a web developer working on a complex user
interface, that's not an abstract philosophical question. If you're implementing
custom mouse input behavior, it's crucial to keep user intent in mind. If a user
clicks on a link with their mouse's middle button, for instance, then it's
reasonable to assume that they wanted to open a new tab with that link's
contents. If a user middle-clicks on a random UI element, then it you may want
to assume that it was inadvertent, and ignore that input, while a primary button
click would be expected to trigger a response from the UI.

It's possible, if a bit cumbersome, to model these nuanced interactions via a
single `click` event listener. You would have to explicitly check the
[`button`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button)
property of the
[`MouseEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent),
to see whether it was set to `0`, representing the primary button,
versus anything else, with `1` usually representing the middle
button, and so on. But not many developers go as far as explicitly checking the
`button` property, leading to code that handles all
`click`s identically, regardless of which button was pressed.

Starting with Chrome 55, a new type of `MouseEvent`, called `auxclick`, is fired
in response to any clicks made with a non-primary button. Accompanying this new
event is a corresponding change in behavior of the `click` event: it will only
fire when the primary mouse button is pressed. We hope that these changes will
make it easier for web developers to write event handlers that respond to only
the type of clicks that they care about, without having to specifically check
the `MouseEvent.button` property.

## Reduce false positives

As mentioned, one motivation for creating `auxclick` was to avoid deployment of
custom `click` handlers that mistakenly override the "middle-click-opens-a-tab"
behavior. For example, imagine that you've written a `click` event handler that
uses the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
to rewrite the location bar, and implement custom single-page navigations. It
might look something like:

    document.querySelector('#my-link').addEventListener('click', event => {
      event.preventDefault();
      // ...call history.pushState(), use client-side rendering, etc....
    });

Your custom logic might work as intended when triggered by a mouse's primary
button, but if that code runs when a middle button is clicked, it's effectively
a false positive. Prior to the new behavior, you'd end up preventing the default
action of opening a new tab, which runs counter to your user's expectations.
While you could explicitly check for `event.button === 0` at the start of your
handler, and only execute the code if that's the case, it's easy to forget, or
never realize it's necessary to do that.

## Only run the code you need

The flip side of fewer false positives is that `auxclick` callbacks will only
run when there's actually a non-primary mouse button clicked. If you have code
that needs to, for example, calculate an appropriate destination URL before
opening a new tab, you can listen for `auxclick` and include that logic in your
callback. It won't incur the overhead of being run when the primary mouse button
is clicked.

## Browser support and compatibility

This new behavior is currently only implemented in Chrome 55. As mentioned in
the [initial
proposal](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/new-event-for-non-primary-button-click/1527),
feedback (both positive and negative) from the web developer community is
appreciated. Filing a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/WICG/auxclick/issues) is
the best way to share that feedback with the folks who are working on the
standardization process.

In the meantime, developers don't have to wait for `auxclick` to be widely
available to follow some best practices for handling mouse events. If you take
the time to check the value of the `MouseEvent.button` property at the start of
your `click` event handler, you can ensure that you take appropriate action. The
following pattern will handle primary and auxiliary clicks differently, whether
or not there's native support for `auxclick`:

    function handlePrimaryClick(event) {
      // ...code to handle the primary button click...
    }
    
    function handleAuxClick(event) {
      // ...code to handle the auxiliary button clickâ€¦.
    }
    
    document.querySelector('#my-link').addEventListener('click', event => {
      if (event.button === 0) {
        return handlePrimaryClick(event);
      }
    
    
      // This provides fallback behavior in browsers without auxclick.
      return handleAuxClick(event);
    });
    
    // Explicitly listen for auxclick in browsers that support it.
    document.querySelector('#my-link').addEventListener('auxclick', handleAuxClick);
