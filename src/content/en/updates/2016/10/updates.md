We launched [Web**Fundamentals**](/web/fundamentals/) two years ago to help
ensure that developers had the latest guidance on how to build great sites and 
apps that worked well on desktop, but more importantly, on
[mobile](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/11/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html). 

A lot has chanced since then, the mobile web experience
has improved dramatically and it's opened up a ton of new possibilities. 
[Service workers](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers)
let us build a web that is instant and reliable.
[Progressive Web Apps](/web/progressive-web-apps/) raise the bar for building
amazing web experiences. 

Last week, we launched a new visual design for [Web**Fundamentals**](/web/fundamentals/)
to make it easier for you to find the content you're looking for, and get the
information you need. We updated content to ensure it's accurate and
added a number of new articles to help you build better web experiences and
amazing Progressive Web Apps. 

Some of the new content includes:

* A brand new [Accessibility section](/web/fundamentals/accessibility/),
  covering the fundamentals of focus, semantics, and ARIA.
* Refined the [tools](/web/tools/) section - so you can 
  find all the latest and greatest information about Chrome DevTools and 
  libraries such as [sw-precache](/web/tools/service-worker-libraries/#service-worker-precache) 
  and [sw-toolbox](/web/tools/service-worker-libraries/#service-worker-toolbox)
* Updated our [Progressive Web Apps](/web/progressive-web-apps/) 
  guidance including an [Offline cookbook](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/), 
  a [Service Worker life-cycle](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/service-worker/lifecycle) guide,
  an introduction to [App Shell](/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell) and a
  getting started guide for [Shadow DOM](/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) 
  and [Web Push](/web/fundamentals/push-notifications)
* Added a new [Instant and Reliable Loading](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/) 
  section, and updated our guidance on [hardware integrations](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/) 
  with guidance on using [cameras](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/capturing-images/) 
  and [microphones](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/recording-audio/), 
  as well as created a new [UX Basics](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/ux-basics/)
  guide.

Of course, we still have lots of work to do, there's new guidance that needs
to be developed, new content that needs to be written, and issues that need
to be fixed. But, we're working on it.

One of the goals for this update was to make it easier for **you** to
contribute. We've majorly simplified the development process, removing many
of the pre-req's that used to exist and shortened the deployment process. If
you find an issue, you can either file it in our 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/google/WebFundamentals/issues) or fix it
yourself and submit a pull request to our 
[Web**Fundamentals** GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/WebFundamentals/).  

As we create and update [developers.google.com/web](/web/)
we also have to think about the future of our other resources. Many of you will 
know that our team created and, through the community, supported the growth of
HTML5Rocks but over the last two years it has seen no updates. We've already 
migrated _updates.html5rocks.com_ to 
[Web **Updates**](/web/updates/) and we are working to move additional content
from HTML5Rocks to here. We've added support for HTTPS to HTML5Rocks, and
are commited to ensuring that the great content that's there, won't
disappear.

I personally want to thank our 
[contributors](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/graphs/contributors),
the [developers](/web/resources/contributors) who have helped translate
content, and you. Your feedback, bug reports, translations, new content,
questions, and the content you've contributed to HTML5Rocks and
Web**Fundamentals** has been invaluable. We couldn't have done it without
your help! Thank you!
