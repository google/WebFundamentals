## Consider Canary {: #canary }

[canary]: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html

If you're on Mac or Windows, consider using [Chrome Canary][canary] as your default
development browser. Canary gives you access to the latest DevTools features.

Note: Canary is released as soon as its built, without testing. This means that Canary
breaks about once-a-month. It's usually fixed within a day. You can go back to using Chrome
Stable while Canary is broken.
