# Web Components v0 deprecation {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/yoichiosato.html" %}

A part of web interoperability for [Web Components v1](/web/updates/2017/01/webcomponents-org),
Chrome is removing
[Shadow DOM v0](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/),
[Custom Elements v0](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/)
 and [HTML Imports](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/)
  in Mar, 2019 at Chrome 73.

[Intent to Deprecate](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/h-JwMiPUnuU/sl79aLoLBQAJ)


## Motivation

Shadow DOM v0, Custom Elements v0, and HTML Imports (hereinafter, called v0 features)
 were launched in 2014, but
they did not get adopted by other browser engines. Instead, Shadow DOM v1,
Custom Elements v1, and ES modules are widely adopted by various browser engines
today. Chrome shipped Shadow DOM v1 / Custom Elements v1 in 2016 and ES
modules in 2017.
Chrome is removing all of the v0 APIs at the same time because we've found the APIs are often used together. Removing them all at the same time will help developers migrate to the V1 APIs.

## Migration support
If your site and/or library is using this features, you should upgrade them to
the v1 APIs.
Use `$ chrome --disable-blink-features=ShadowDOMV0,CustomElementsV0,HTMLImports`
on command line to launch Chrome disabled v0 features for testing if your site works without those APIs.

### Polyfill

Now webcomponents polyfill supports v0 features on the all-v0-disabled Chrome. A web site using the polyfill should continue to work.
This is also another option for the web authors.
You can install the polyfill on the site using v0 features directly to keep
it working.
There are also other alternative polyfills for each feature (e.g.
[AshleyScirraâ€™s HTML Imports polyfill](https://github.com/AshleyScirra/html-imports-polyfill)).


### Postpone removal via origin trial

For web authors who need more time to handle this removal, you can re-enable
these features with an [Origin Trial](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md).
With a token generated for the trial, your site can continue to use them for
an additional year, until Chrome 81.
Chrome 81 is the planned milestone when we remove implementation code entirely so
the trial token might last earlier.

The trial name is `WebComponentsV0`. With that token, you can use Shadow DOM v0,
Custom Elements v0, and HTML Imports APIs. Trial registration will be open
after Chrome 73 beta release."

## Remove Shadow DOM v0
Shadow DOM v0 API `Element.createShadowRoot()` is removed.
Instead Chrome has v1 API `Element.attachShadow()` to create Shadow Root.
V1 is not backward compatible to v0 in many points (distribution, styling, focusing,,,).
See a [document](https://hayato.io/2016/shadowdomv1/) for further comparing and
our [document](/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) describes v1 functions and usage.


## Remove Custom Elements v0
Custom Elements v0 API `document.registerElement()` is removed.
Instead Chrome has v1 API `window.customElements.define()` to define Custom Element.
V1 is not backward compatible to v0.
Our [document](/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements) describes v1 functions and usage.


## Remove HTML Imports

HTML Imports is removed.
[HTML Modules](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/645) will serve
similar functionality.
Though Chrome doesn't have any direct replacement for HTML Imports yet, Chrome is removing this for healthy web:
a site HTML Imports mandatory doesn't work on other browsers.
