# Prototyping Platform Packs for Lighthouse {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/housseindjirdeh.html" %}

**TL;DR:** Platform Packs is a new Lighthouse feature that is currently under
development, and we would love to hear your feedback!


By auditing for performance, accessibility and other best practices,
[Lighthouse](/web/tools/lighthouse/) provides developers with important guidance
that they can use to improve their web pages. Many developers, however, use
different technologies to build their site (such as a CMS or JavaScript
framework) and may need more specific advice.

**Platform Packs** is a feature that will extend Lighthouse to also include
specific platform-based recommendations. Instead of only surfacing generalized
advice, additional messages will be provided that explain how to address certain
audits with platforms that have been detected to be used on a website.

alt="Prototype of the WordPress Platform Pack">

The community will get to decide what the recommendations for different
platforms should be. A separate
[repository](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-platform-packs) has been
created to consolidate ideas and a prototype of this feature can already be
viewed with [Lighthouse
Viewer](https://houssein.me/lighthouse/viewer-wordpress/?gist=9efc3fc22dc500620c884db995e3fb6c).

## Which platforms will Lighthouse support?

We are starting with WordPress as our first prototype platform, and plan to
expand the list in the future to other popular CMS and JavaScript frameworks
(React, Angular, etc...).
 
## How will this feature show up on my Lighthouse report?

There are two options that are being considered:

* Automatically detect which platforms are being used on a page (such as
  WordPress) and immediately surface additional platform-pack messages for
  applicable audits.
* Automatically detect which platforms are being is being used on a page (such
  as WordPress) and provide a toggle that allows the user to switch between a
  regular and an updated version of Lighthouse.

## How will platform-specific descriptions be modified by the community?

Weâ€™re exploring options to enable anyone to recommend platform-specific
recommendations in the near future. In the meantime, feel free to submit PRs
directly to the [Lighthouse Platform
Packs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-platform-packs) repository or
leave suggestions in this [Google
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D4sz4NmhTjekJR2HIFX6QvO76c9PU2LHKDBf19YLnrA/edit?usp=sharing)
for WordPress.

## Feedback

We would love to hear any feedback you may have:

* Which platforms should we prioritize in the future after WordPress?
* Do you have a preference for how this feature will show up on your Lighthouse
  report?
* Any other suggestions?

Leave a comment in this [discussion
issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-platform-packs/issues/3) if
