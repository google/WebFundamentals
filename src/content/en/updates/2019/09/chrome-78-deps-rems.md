## Disallow sync XHR in page dismissal

Chrome now disallows synchronous XHR during page dismissal when the page is
being navigated away from or closed by the user. This applies to the following
events:

* `beforeunload`
* `unload`
* `pagehide`
* `visibilitychange`

To ensure that data is sent to the server when a page unloads, we recommend
SendBeacon or Fetch keep-alive. 

For now, enterprise users can use the AllowSyncXHRInPageDismissal policy flag to
allow synchronous XHR requests during page unload. We expect to remove this flag
in Chrome 82.

XSS Auditor has been removed from Chrome√ü. The XSS Auditor can introduce
cross-site information leaks and mechanisms to bypass the Auditor are widely
known.
