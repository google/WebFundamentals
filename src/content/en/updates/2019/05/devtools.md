# What's New In DevTools (Chrome 76) {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/kaycebasques.html" %}

Hello! Here's what's new in [Chrome DevTools](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) in Chrome 76.

## Autocomplete with CSS values {: #values }

When adding style declarations to a DOM node sometimes the declaration value is easier to
remember than the declaration name. For example, when making a `<p>` node bold, the value
`bold` might be easier to remember than the name `font-weight`. The Style pane's autocomplete UI now
supports CSS values. If you remember what keyword value you want, but can't remember the property
name, try typing the value and autocomplete should help you find the name you're looking
for.

    <code>font-weight: bold</code>.

## A new UI for network settings {: #settings }

[settings]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/shared/settings.png

The Network panel previously had a usability issue where options like the throttling
menu were unreachable when the DevTools window was narrow. To fix this issue and
de-clutter the Network panel, a few lesser-used options have been moved behind the new
**Network Settings** ![Network Settings][settings]{: .inline-icon } pane.

The following options have moved to **Network Settings**: **Use Large Request Rows**, **Group By Frame**,
**Show Overview**, **Capture Screenshots**. Figure 3 maps the old locations to the new ones.

## WebSocket messages in HAR exports {: #websocket }

When [exporting a HAR file from the Network panel](#HAR) to share network logs with your
colleagues, your HAR file now includes WebSocket messages. The `_webSocketMessages`
property begins with an underscore to indicate that it's a custom field.

    ...
    "_webSocketMessages": [
      {
        "type": "send",
        "time": 1558730482.5071473,
        "opcode": 1,
        "data": "Hello, WebSockets!"
      },
      {
        "type": "receive",
        "time": 1558730482.5883863,
        "opcode": 1,
        "data": "Hello, WebSockets!"
      }
    ]

## HAR import and export buttons {: #HAR }

[export]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/shared/export.png
[import]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/shared/import.png

Share network logs with colleagues more easily with the new **Export All As HAR With Content**
![Export][export]{: .inline-icon } and **Import HAR File** ![Import][import]{: .inline-icon }
buttons. HAR importing and exporting have existed in DevTools for a while. The more 
discoverable buttons are the new change.

## Real-time total memory usage {: #memory }

The Memory panel now shows total memory usage in real-time.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2019/05/memory.png"
       alt="Real-time total memory usage."/>
  <figcaption>
    Figure 5. The bottom of the Memory panel shows that the page
    is using <b>43.4 MB</b> of memory in total. <b>209 KB/s</b> indicates that
    total memory usage is increasing 209 KB per second.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

See also the [Performance Monitor](/web/updates/2017/11/devtools-release-notes#perf-monitor) for
tracking memory usage in real-time.

## Service worker registration port numbers {: #ports }

The **Service Workers** pane now includes port numbers in its titles to make it 
easier to keep track of which service worker you're debugging.

## Inspect Background Fetch and Background Sync events {: #background }

[fetch]: https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/background-fetch-api-get-ready-to-use-it-69cca522cd8f
[sync]: /web/updates/2015/12/background-sync

Use the new **Background Services** section of the **Application** panel to monitor
[Background Fetch][fetch] and [Background Sync][sync] events.

## Puppeteer for Firefox {: #puppeteer }

<aside class="note">
  Puppeteer is a high-level Node API for automating Chromium. We mention Puppeteer in the DevTools 
  release notes because Puppeteer was started by the DevTools team and because you might be able to
  use it to automate tasks that were previously only possible in DevTools.
</aside>

Puppeteer for Firefox is a new experimental project that enables you to automate Firefox with the
Puppeteer API. In other words, you can now automate Firefox and Chromium with the same Node API,
as demonstrated in the video below.

<div class="video-wrapper-full-width">
  <iframe class="devsite-embedded-youtube-video" data-video-id="YSni7t2ktMA"
          data-autohide="1" data-showinfo="0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

After running `node example.js`, Firefox opens and the text `page` is inserted into the 
search box on Puppeteer's documentation site. Then the same task is repeated in Chromium.

Check out the Puppeteer talk by [Joel](https://twitter.com/joeleinbinder) and
[Andrey](https://twitter.com/aslushnikov) from Google I/O 2019 to learn more about Puppeteer 
and Puppeteer for Firefox. The Firefox announcement happens around 4:05.

## Consider Canary {: #canary }

[canary]: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html

If you're on Mac or Windows, consider using [Chrome Canary][canary] as your default
development browser. Canary gives you access to the latest DevTools features.

Note: Canary is released as soon as its built, without testing. This means that Canary
breaks about once-a-month. It's usually fixed within a day. You can go back to using Chrome
Stable while Canary is broken.
