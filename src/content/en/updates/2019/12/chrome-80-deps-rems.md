## Disallow Synchronous XMLHTTPRequest() in Page Dismissal

Chrome now disallows synchronous calls to `XMLHTTPRequest()` during page
dismissal when the page is being navigated away from or is closed by the user.
This applies to `beforeunload`, `unload`, `pagehide`, and `visibilitychange`.

To ensure that data is sent to the server when a page unloads, we recommend
`sendBeacon()` or `Fetch` `keep-alive`. For now, enterprise users can use the
`AllowSyncXHRInPageDismissal` policy flag and developers can use the origin
trial flag `allow-sync-xhr-in-page-dismissal` to allow synchronous XHR requests
during page unload. This is a temporary "opt-out" measure, and we expect to
remove this flag in Chrome 82. 

For details about this and the alternatives, see [Disallowing synchronous
XMLHTTPRequest() during page dismissal]().

## FTP support deprecated

The current FTP implementation in Chrome has no support for encrypted
connections (FTPS), nor proxies. Usage of FTP in the browser is sufficiently low
that it is no longer viable to invest in improving the existing FTP client. In
addition more capable FTP clients are available on all affected platforms.

Chrome 72 removed support for fetching document subresources over FTP and
rendering of top level FTP resources. Currently navigating to FTP URLs results
in showing a directory listing or a download depending on the type of resource.
A bug in Google Chrome 74 and later resulted in dropping support for accessing
FTP URLs over HTTP proxies. Proxy support for FTP was removed entirely in Google
Chrome 76.

The remaining capabilities of Google Chromeâ€™s FTP implementation are restricted
to either displaying a directory listing or downloading a resource over
unencrypted connections. 

The deprecation timeline is tentatively set as follows:

**Chrome 80 (stable in February 2020)**

FTP is disabled by default for *non-enterprise clients*, but may be turned on
using either the `--enable-ftp` or the `--enable-features=FtpProtocol`
command-line flags. Alternatively, it can be turned on using the `#enable-ftp`
option on chrome://flags.

**Chrome 81 (stable in March 2020)**

FTP is disabled by default for *all Chrome installations*, but may be turned on
using either the `--enable-ftp` or the `--enable-features=FtpProtocol`
command-line flags.

**Chrome 82 (stable in April 2020)**

FTP support will be completely removed.

## Disallow allow popups during page unload

Pages may no longer use `window.open()` to open a new page during unload. The
Chrome popup blocker already prohibited this, but now it is prohibited whether
or not the popup blocker is enabled. 

Enterprises can use the `AllowPopupsDuringPageUnload` policy flag to allow
popups during unload. Chrome expects to remove this flag in Chrome 82.

## Non-origin-clean ImageBitmap serialization and transferring removed

Errors will now be raised when a script tries to serialize or transfer a
non-origin-clean ImageBitmap. A non-origin-clean ImageBitmap is one that
contains data from cross cross-origin images that is not verified by CORS logic.

## Protocol handling now requires a secure context

The methods `registerProtocolHandler()` and `unregisterProtocolHandler()` now
require a secure context. These methods capable of reconfiguring client states
such that they would allow transmission of potentially sensitive data over a
network. 

The `registerProtocolHandler()` method gives a webpage a mechanism to register
itself to handle a protocol after a user consents. For example, a web-based
email application could register to handle the `mailto:` scheme. The corresponding
`unregisterProtocolHandler()` method allows a site to abandon its
protocol-handling registration.

## Web Components v0 removed

Web Components v0 are now removed from Chrome. The Web Components v1 APIs are a
web platform standard that has shipped in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and (soon)
Edge. For guidance on upgrading, read [Web Components update: more time to

## Remove -webkit-appearance:button for arbitrary elements

Changes `-webkit-appearance:button` to work only with `<button>` and `<input>`
buttons. If `button` is specified for an unsupported element, the element has
the default appearance. All other `-webkit-appearance` keywords already have
such restriction.
