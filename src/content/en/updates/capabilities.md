# Capabilities {: .page-title }

There are some capabilities, like file system access, idle detection, and
more that are available to native but aren’t available on the web. These
missing capabilities mean some types of apps can't be delivered on the
web, or are less useful.

We feel strongly that when a developer can’t build their app on the open web
we have failed. We are [committed to a more capable web.](#TODO)

We want to close the capability gap between the web and native and make it
easy for developers to build great experiences on the open web. We plan to
design and develop these new capabilities in an open and transparent way,
using the existing open web platform standards processes while getting early
feedback from developers and other browser vendors as we iterate on the
design, to ensure an interoperable design.

Your feedback is critical to help us ensure we’re shipping the right features,
but when it comes in late in the process, it can be hard to change course.
That’s why we’re starting to ask for feedback earlier. When actionable
technical and use-case feedback comes in early, it’s easier to course correct
or even stop development, without having shipped poorly thought out or badly
implemented features. Features being developed at WICG are not set in stone,
and your input can make a big difference in how they evolve.

        The writable files API is designed to increase interoperability of
        web applications with native applications, making it possible for users
        to choose files or directories that a web app can interact with on the
        native file system, and without having to use a native wrapper like
        Electron to ship your web app.
