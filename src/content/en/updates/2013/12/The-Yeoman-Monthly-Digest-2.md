# The Yeoman Monthly Digest #2 {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/addyosmani.html" %}


Allo’ Allo’ and Happy Holidays! Welcome to the second issue of the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) monthly digest – our regular round-up of articles, tips, generators and videos to help you stay on top of what’s new with your favourite man-in-a-hat. We hope you find the updates below helpful!

## Grunt pro-tips

It’s tempting to try every Grunt plug-in out there – there’s a bajillion! It’s also easy to get carried away. Before you know it, you’re staring at your terminal far longer than you used to be, waiting for your tasks to complete. It can be frustrating during your build, but *super* frustrating during your watch.

Fortunately, the community has been working towards speeding up your development cycle even more.

* Reduce your Grunt compilation time with [this](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/975#issuecomment-29058707) custom task trick
* Use [grunt-newer](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer) to only run Grunt tasks on files that changed
* Run tasks concurrently with [grunt-concurrent](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-concurrent) so multiple tasks can be run simultaneously

Some other tips:

* Use [load-grunt-tasks](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) to load multiple tasks automatically rather than `loadNpmTask`-ing it yourself
* [Reuse multiple Grunt environments across multiple projects](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-source)
