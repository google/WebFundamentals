### tl;dr {: .hide-from-toc }

Starting in Chrome 68, HTTP requests that check for updates to the service worker script will no
longer be fulfilled by the [HTTP cache](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching)
by default. This works around a [common developer pain point](/web/tools/workbox/guides/service-worker-checklist#cache-control_of_your_service_worker_file),
in which setting an inadvertent `Cache-Control:` header on your service worker script could lead
to delayed updates.

If you've already opted-out of HTTP caching for your `/service-worker.js` script by serving it
with `Cache-Control: max-age=0`, then you shouldn't see any changes due to the new default
behavior.

## Background

Every time you navigate to a new page that's under a service worker's scope, explicitly call [`registration.update()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/update)
from JavaScript, or when a service worker is "woken up" via a `push` or `sync` event, the browser
will, in parallel, request the JavaScript resource that was originally passed in to the
`navigator.serviceWorker.register()` call, to look for updates to the service worker script.

For the purposes of this article, let's assume its URL is `/service-worker.js` and that it
contains a single call to [`importScripts()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts),
which loads additional code that's run inside the service worker:

```js
// Inside our /service-worker.js file:
importScripts('path/to/import.js');

// Other top-level code goes here.
```

## What's changing?

Prior to Chrome 68, the update request for `/service-worker.js` would be made via the HTTP cache
(as most fetches are). This meant if the script was originally sent with `Cache-Control:
max-age=600`, updates within the next 600 seconds (10 minutes) would not go to the network, so the
user may not receive the most up-to-date version of the service worker. However, if `max-age` was
greater than 86400 (24 hours), it would be treated as if it were 86400, to avoid users being stuck
with a particular version forever.

Starting in 68, the HTTP cache will be ignored when requesting updates to the service worker
script, so existing web applications may see an increase in the frequency of requests for their
service worker script. Requests for `importScripts` will still go via the HTTP cache. But this is
just the default—a new registration option, `updateViaCache` is available that offers control over
this behavior.

### updateViaCache

Developers can now pass in a new option when calling `navigator.serviceWorker.register()`: the [`updateViaCache` parameter](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#enumdef-serviceworkerupdateviacache).
It takes one of three values: `'imports'`, `'all'`, or `'none'`.

The values determine if and how the browser's standard [HTTP cache](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/)
comes into play when making the HTTP request to check for updated service worker resources.

- When set to `imports`, the HTTP cache will never be consulted when checking for updates to the
  `/service-worker.js` script, but will be consulted when fetching any imported scripts
  (`path/to/import.js`, in our example). This is the default, and it matches the behavior starting
  in Chrome 68.

- When set to `'all'`, the HTTP cache will be consulted when making requests for both the
  top-level `/service-worker.js` script, as well as any scripts imported inside of the service
  worker, like `path/to/import.js`. This option corresponds to the previous behavior in Chrome,
  prior to Chrome 68.

- When set to `'none'`, the HTTP cache will not be consulted when making requests for either the
  top-level `/service-worker.js` or for any imported scripted, such as the hypothetical
  `path/to/import.js`.

For example, the following code will register a service worker, and ensure that the HTTP cache is
never consulted when checking for updates to either the `/service-worker.js` script, or for any
scripts that are referenced via `importScripts()` inside of `/service-worker.js`:

```js
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {
    updateViaCache: 'none',
    // Optionally, set 'scope' here, if needed.
  });
}
```

## What do developers need to do?

If you've effectively opted-out of HTTP caching for your `/service-worker.js` script by serving it
with `Cache-Control: max-age=0` (or a similar value), then you shouldn't see any changes due to
the new default behavior.

If you do serve your `/service-worker.js` script with HTTP caching enabled, either intentionally
or because it's just the [default for your hosting environment](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/#max-age-on-mutable-content-is-often-the-wrong-choice),
you may start seeing an uptick of additional HTTP requests for `/service-worker.js` made against
your server—these are requests that used to be fulfilled by the HTTP cache. If you want to
continue allowing the `Cache-Control` header value to influence the freshness of your
`/service-worker.js`', you'll need to start explicitly setting `updateViaCache: 'all'` when
registering your service worker.

Given that there may be a long-tail of users on older browser versions, it's still a good idea to
continue setting the `Cache-Control: max-age=0` HTTP header on service worker scripts, even though
newer browsers might ignore them.

Developers can use this opportunity to decide whether they want to explicitly opt their imported
scripts out of HTTP caching now, and add in `updateViaCache: 'none'` to their service worker
registration if appropriate.
