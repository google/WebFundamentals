# Chacmool: Augmented reality in Chrome Canary {: .page-title }

When preparing for Google I/O, we wanted to highlight the exciting possibilities
of augmented reality (AR) on the web. Chacmool is an educational web experience
demo we built to show how easily web based AR can help users engage with AR
experiences. The web makes AR convenient and accessible everywhere.

</div>

We have now enabled this demo on
[Chrome Canary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.canary)
on
[ARCore-compatible Android devices](/ar/discover/supported-devices) with Android O or later. You'll also need to
[install ARCore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign).
 This work relies on a new WebXR proposal (the
[WebXR Hit Test API](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test/blob/master/explainer.md)),
so it is under a flag and intended to stay in Canary as we test and refine the
new API proposal with other members of the Immersive Web Community Group. In
fact, to access the demo you'll need to enable two flags in `chrome://flags:`
`#webxr` and `#webxr-hit-test`.  Once you have these both enabled and have restarted
Canary, you can check out the [Chacmool](https://web-education-ar-demo.appspot.com/) demo.  

Note: If you want to be notified of spec updates as they land in Chrome, the
[Immersive Web Early Adopters Guide](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-reference/) is
kept in a GitHub repo and updated whenever spec changes land in Chrome. To be
notified of those updates watch [its repo on
GitHub](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-reference).

The [Chacmool AR experience](https://web-education-ar-demo.appspot.com/) is centered around
education, leveraging AR's immersive and interactive nature to help users learn
about ancient Chacmool sculptures. Users can place a life size statue in their
reality and move around to see the sculpture from various different angles and
distances. The immersive nature of AR allows users to freely explore, discover
and play with content, just like they can in the real world. When viewing an
object in AR, as opposed to seeing it on a flat 2D screen, we are able to get a
deep understanding of what we are looking at because we can see it from many
different angles and distances using a very intuitive interaction model: walking
around the object, and getting physically closer or further away.   Also, in
this experience, there are annotations placed directly on the sculpture. This
enables users to directly connect what is described in text and where those
features are on the sculpture.

This demo was built over the course of about a month to build, leveraging some
of the components from the WebXR team's first web based AR demo,
[WebAR-Article](https://blog.google/products/google-vr/augmented-reality-web-everyone/).
Information about the sculpture was sourced from its
[Google's Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/a-chacmool-figure-holding-a-bowl-in-the-ruins-of-templo-mayor-in-mexico-city/nQFDnZcHsxuiiA)
page, and the 3D model was provided by Google Arts & Culture's partner,
[CyArk](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/cyark).  To get the 3D model
ready for the web, a combination of Meshlab, and Mesh Mixer was used to repair
the model and decimate its mesh to decrease its file size. Then
[Draco](https://github.com/google/draco), a library for compressing and
decompressing 3D geometric meshes and point clouds
was used to reduce the model's file size from 44.3 megabytes to a mere 225
kilobytes. Finally, a web worker is used to load the model on a background
thread so the page remains interactive while the model is loaded and
decompressed, an operation that would typically cause jank and prevent the page
from being scrolled.  

We can't stress enough that, since we were developing on desktop and deploying
onto a phone, using
[Chrome's remote debugging tools](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/)
to help inspect the experience creates a great fast iteration cycle between code
changes, and there are amazing developer tools in Chrome for debugging and
checking performance.

## Best practices for AR/VR experiences

Most design and engineering guidelines for designing for native AR experiences
apply for making web based AR experiences. If you'd like to learn more about
general best practices, check out the [AR design
guidelines](https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/ar-design/) we recently
released.

In particular, when designing web based AR experiences, it's best to use the
entire screen (i.e. go fullscreen similar to how video players going fullscreen
on mobile) when using AR. This prevents users from scrolling the view or getting
distracted by other elements on the web page. The transition into AR should be
smooth and seamless, showing the camera view before entering AR onboarding (e.g.
drawing a reticle). What is important to note about web based AR is that, unlike
native, developers do not have access to the camera frame, lighting estimation,
anchors, or planes (yet), so it's important that designers and developers keep
these limitations in mind when designing a web based AR experience.

In addition, due to the variety of devices used for web experiences, it's
important that performance is optimized to create the best user experience. So:
keep poly counts low, try to get away with as few lights as possible, precompute
shadows if possible and minimize draw calls. When displaying text in AR,
[use modern (i.e. signed distance field based) text rendering techniques](/web/showcase/2017/within)
to make sure the text is clear and readable from all distances and angles. When
placing annotations, think about the user's gaze as another input and only show
annotations when they are relevant (i.e. proximity based annotations that show
up when a user is focus on an area of interest).

Lastly, because this content is web based, it's important to also apply general
best design practices for the web. Be sure the site provides a good experience
across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile, headset, etc) -  supporting
[progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)
means also designing for non-AR-capable devices (i.e. show a 3D model viewer on
non-AR devices). 	

If you are interested in developing your own web-based AR experiences, we have a
companion post here that will give more details about how to get started
building AR on the Web yourself. (You can also check out the source to the
Chacmool demo.) The WebXR Device API is actively in development and we'd love
feedback so we can ensure it enables all types of applications and use cases, so
[please head over to GitHub and join the conversation](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr)!
