# Audio Worklet Design Pattern {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/hongchanchoi.html" %}

The [previous article](/web/updates/2017/12/audio-worklet)
on Audio Worklet detailed the basic concepts and usage. Since its launch
in Chrome 66 there have been many requests for more examples of how it can be
used in actual applications. The Audio Worklet unlocks the full potential of
WebAudio, but taking advantage of it can be challenging because it requires
understanding concurrent programming wrapped with several JS APIs. Even for
developers who are familiar with WebAudio, integrating the Audio Worklet
with other APIs (e.g. WebAssembly) can be difficult.

This article will give the reader a better understanding of how to use the
Audio Worklet in real-world settings and to offer tips to draw on its fullest
power. Be sure to check out
[code examples and live demos](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet#design-pattern)
as well!

## Recap: Audio Worklet

Before diving in, let's quickly recap terms and facts around the Audio Worklet
system which was previously introduced in
[this post](/web/updates/2017/12/audio-worklet).

  - [BaseAudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext):
    Web Audio API's primary object.
  - [Audio Worklet](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#audioworklet): A
    special script file loader for the Audio Worklet operation. Belongs to
    BaseAudioContext. A BaseAudioContext can have one Audio Worklet. The loaded
    script file is evaluated in the AudioWorkletGlobalScope and is used to
    create the AudioWorkletProcessor instances.
  - [AudioWorkletGlobalScope](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#audioworkletglobalscope)
    : A special JS global scope for the Audio Worklet operation. Runs on a
    dedicated rendering thread for the WebAudio. A BaseAudioContext can have one
    AudioWorkletGlobalScope.
  - [AudioWorkletNode](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#audioworkletnode)
    : An AudioNode designed for the Audio Worklet operation. Instantiated from a
    BaseAudioContext. A BaseAudioContext can have multiple AudioWorkletNodes
    similarly to the native AudioNodes.
  - [AudioWorkletProcessor](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#audioworkletprocessor)
    : A counterpart of the AudioWorkletNode. The actual guts of the
    AudioWorkletNode processing the audio stream by the user-supplied code. It
    is instantiated in the AudioWorkletGlobalScope when a AudioWorkletNode is
    constructed. An AudioWorkletNode can have one matching
    AudioWorkletProcessor.

## Design Patterns

### Using Audio Worklet with WebAssembly

  - [Example code](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/)

[WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) is a perfect
companion for AudioWorkletProcessor. The combination of these two features
brings a variety of advantages to audio processing on the web, but the two
biggest benefits are: a) bringing existing C/C++ audio processing code into the
WebAudio ecosystem and b) avoiding the overhead of JS JIT compilation and
garbage collection in the audio processing code.

The former is important to developers with an existing investment in audio
processing code and libraries, but the latter is critical for nearly all users
of the API. In the world of WebAudio, the timing budget for the stable audio
stream is quite demanding: it is only 3ms at the sample rate of 44.1Khz. Even a
slight hiccup in the audio processing code can cause glitches. The developer
must optimize the code for faster processing, but also minimize the amount of JS
garbage being generated. Using WebAssembly can be a solution that addresses both
problems at the same time: it is faster and generates no garbage from the code.

The next section describes how WebAssembly can be used with an Audio Worklet and
the accompanied code example can be found
[here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/).
For the basic tutorial on how to use Emscripten and WebAssembly (especially the
Emscripten glue code), please take a look at
[this article](/web/updates/2018/03/emscripting-a-c-library).

#### Setting Up

It all sounds great, but we need a bit of structure to set things up properly.
The first design question to ask is how and where to instantiate a WebAssembly
module. After fetching the Emscripten's glue code, there are two paths for the
module instantiation:

  1. Instantiate a WebAssembly module by loading the glue code into the
    AudioWorkletGlobalScope via `audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule()`.
  1. Instantiate a WebAssembly module in the main scope, then transfer the
    module via the AudioWorkletNode's constructor options.

The decision largely depends on your design and preference, but the idea is that
the WebAssembly module can generate a WebAssembly instance in the
AudioWorkletGlobalScope, which becomes an audio processing kernel within an
AudioWorkletProcessor instance.

<figure>
  <img
      class="diagram"
      src="/web/updates/images/2018/06/aw-design-pattern-1.png">
  <figcaption>
    WebAssembly module instantiation pattern A: Using <code>.addModule()</code>
    call
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For pattern A to work correctly, Emscripten needs a couple of options to
generate the correct WebAssembly glue code for our configuration:

```bash
-s BINARYEN_ASYNC_COMPILATION=0 -s SINGLE_FILE=1 --post-js mycode.js
```

These options ensure the synchronous compilation of a WebAssembly module in the
AudioWorkletGlobalScope. It also appends the AudioWorkletProcessor's class
definition in `mycode.js` so it can be loaded after the module is initialized.
The primary reason to use the synchronous compilation is that the promise
resolution of `audioWorklet.addModule()` does not wait for the resolution of
promises in the AudioWorkletGlobalScope. The synchronous loading or compilation
in the main thread is not generally recommended because it blocks the other
tasks in the same thread, but here we can bypass the rule because the
compilation happens on the AudioWorkletGlobalScope, which runs off of the main
thread. (See
[this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Instance)
for the more info.)

<figure>
  <img
      class="diagram"

  <figcaption>
    WASM module instantiation pattern B: Using AudioWorkletNode constructor's
    cross-thread transfer
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The pattern B can be useful if asynchronous heavy-lifting is required. It
utilizes the main thread for fetching the glue code from the server and
compiling the module. Then it will transfer the WASM module via the constructor
of AudioWorkletNode. This pattern makes even more sense when you have to load
the module dynamically after the AudioWorkletGlobalScope starts rendering the
audio stream. Depending on the size of the module, compiling it in the middle of
the rendering can cause glitches in the stream.

Currently, the pattern B is only supported behind an experimental flag because
it requires WebAssembly structured cloning.
(`chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly`)
If a WASM module should be a part of your AudioWorkletNode design, passing it
through AudioWorkletNode constructor can definitely be useful.

#### WASM Heap and Audio Data

WebAssembly code only works on the memory allocated within a dedicated WASM
heap. In order to take advantage of it, the audio data needs to be cloned back
and forth between the WASM heap and the audio data arrays. The
[HeapAudioBuffer](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/gh-pages/audio-worklet/design-pattern/lib/wasm-audio-helper.js#L37)
class in the example code handles this operation nicely.

  <figcaption>
    HeapAudioBuffer class for the easier usage of WASM heap
  </figcaption>
</figure>

There is an [early proposal](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/1384)
under discussion to integrate the WASM heap directly into the Audio Worklet
system. Getting rid of this redundant data cloning between the JS memory and the
WASM heap seems natural, but the specific details need to be worked out.

### Handling Buffer Size Mismatch

  - [Example code](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm-ring-buffer/)

An AudioWorkletNode and AudioWorkletProcessor pair is designed to work like a
regular AudioNode; AudioWorkletNode handles the interaction with other codes
while AudioWorkletProcessor takes care of internal audio processing. Because a
regular AudioNode processes 128
[frames](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#Audio_buffers_frames_samples_and_channels)
at a time, AudioWorkletProcessor must do the same to become a first-class
citizen. This is one of the advantages of the Audio Worklet design that ensures
no additional latency due to internal buffering is introduced within the
AudioWorkletProcessor, but it can be a problem if a processing function requires
a buffer size different than 128 frames. The common solution for such case is to
use a ring buffer, also known as a circular buffer or a FIFO.

Here's a diagram of AudioWorkletProcessor using two ring buffers inside to
accommodate a WASM function that takes 512 frames in and out. (The number 512
here is arbitrarily picked.)

<figure>
  <img
      class="diagram"
      src="/web/updates/images/2018/06/aw-design-pattern-4.png">
  <figcaption>
    Using RingBuffer inside of AudioWorkletProcessor's `process()` method
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The algorithm for diagram would be:

  1. AudioWorkletProcessor pushes 128 frames into the **Input RingBuffer** from
    its Input.
  1. Perform the following steps only if the **Input RingBuffer** has greater
    than or equal to 512 frames.
     1. Pull 512 frames from the **Input RingBuffer**.
     1. Process 512 frames with the given WASM function.
     1. Push 512 frames to the **Output RingBuffer**.
  1. AudioWorkletProcessor pulls 128 frames from the **Output RingBuffer** to
    fill its **Output**.

As shown in the diagram, Input frames always get accumulated into Input
RingBuffer and it handles buffer overflow by overwriting the oldest frame block
in the buffer. That is a reasonable thing to do for a real-time audio
application. Similarly, the Output frame block will always get pulled by the
system. Buffer underflow (not enough data) in Output RingBuffer will result
silence causing a glitch in the stream.

This pattern is useful when replacing ScriptProcessorNode (SPN) with
AudioWorkletNode. Since SPN allows the developer to pick a buffer size between
256 and 4096 frames, so the drop-in substitution of SPN with AudioWorkletNode
can be difficult and using a ring buffer provides a nice workaround. A audio
recorder would be a great example that can be built on top of this design.

However, it is important to understand that this design only reconciles the
buffer size mismatch and it does not give more time to run the given script
code. If the code cannot finish the task within the timing budget of render
quantum (~3ms at 44.1Khz), it will affect the onset timing of subsequent
callback function and eventually cause glitches.

Mixing this design with WebAssembly can be complicated because of memory
management around WASM heap. At the time of writing, the data going in and out
of WASM heap must be cloned but we can utilize HeapAudioBuffer class to make
memory management slightly easier.
[The idea of using user-allocated memory](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/1443)
to reduce redundant data cloning will be discussed in the future.

The RingBuffer class can be found
[here](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/gh-pages/audio-worklet/design-pattern/lib/wasm-audio-helper.js#L170).

### WebAudio Powerhouse: Audio Worklet and SharedArrayBuffer

Note: SharedArrayBuffer is disabled by default at the time of writing. Go to
`chrome://flags` and enable _SharedArrayBuffer_ to play with this feature.

  - [Example code](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/design-pattern/shared-buffer/)

The last design pattern in this article is to put several cutting edge APIs into
one place; Audio Worklet,
[SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer),
[Atomics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics)
and [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker). With this
non-trivial setup, it unlocks a path for existing audio software written in
C/C++ to run in a web browser while maintaining a smooth user experience.

<figure>
  <img
      class="diagram"
      src="/web/updates/images/2018/06/aw-design-pattern-5.png">
  <figcaption>
    An overview of the last design pattern: Audio Worklet, SharedArrayBuffer and
    Worker
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The biggest advantage of this design is being able to use a
[DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope)
solely for audio processing. In Chrome, WorkerGlobalScope runs on a lower
priority thread than the WebAudio rendering thread but it has several advantages
over
[AudioWorkletGlobalScope](https://padenot.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioWorkletGlobalScope)
. DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope is less constrained in terms of the API surface
available in the scope. Also you can expect better support from Emscripten
because the Worker API has existed for some years.

SharedArrayBuffer plays a critical role for this design to work efficiently.
Although both Worker and AudioWorkletProcessor are equipped with asynchronous
messaging
([MessagePort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort)),
it is suboptimal for real-time audio processing because of repetitive memory
allocation and messaging latency. So we allocate a memory block up front that
can be accessed from both threads for fast bidirectional data transfer.

From Web Audio API purist's viewpoint, this design might look suboptimal because
it uses the Audio Worklet as a simple "audio sink" and does everything in the
Worker. But considering the cost of rewriting C/C++ projects in JavaScript can
be prohibitive or even be impossible, this design can be the most efficient
implementation path for such projects.

#### Shared States and Atomics

When using a shared memory for audio data, the access from both sides must be
coordinated carefully. Sharing atomically accessible states is a solution for
such problem. We can take advantage of `Int32Array` backed by a SAB for this
purpose.

<figure>
  <img
      class="diagram"
      src="/web/updates/images/2018/06/aw-design-pattern-6.png">
  <figcaption>
    Synchronization mechanism: SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Synchronization mechanism: SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics

Each field of the States array represents vital information about the shared
buffers. The most important one is a field for the synchronization
(`REQUEST_RENDER`). The idea is that Worker waits for this field to be touched
by AudioWorkletProcessor and process the audio when it wakes up. Along with
SharedArrayBuffer (SAB), Atomics API makes this mechanism possible.

Note that the synchronization of two threads are rather loose. The onset of
`Worker.process()` will be triggered by `AudioWorkletProcessor.process()`
method, but the AudioWorkletProcessor does not wait until the `Worker.process()`
is finished. This is by design; the AudioWorkletProcessor is driven by the audio
callback so it must not be synchronously blocked. In the worst case scenario the
audio stream might suffer from duplicate or drop out but it will eventually
recover when the rendering performance is stabilized.

#### Setting Up and Running

As shown in the diagram above, this design has several components to arrange:
DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope (DWGS), AudioWorkletGlobalScope (AWGS),
SharedArrayBuffer and the main thread. The following steps describe what should
happen in the initialization phase.

##### Initialization

  1. [Main] AudioWorkletNode constructor gets called.
    1. Create Worker.
    1. The associated AudioWorkletProcessor will be created.
  1. [DWGS] Worker creates 2 SharedArrayBuffers. (one for shared states and the
    other for audio data)
  1. [DWGS] Worker sends SharedArrayBuffer references to AudioWorkletNode.
  1. [Main] AudioWorkletNode sends SharedArrayBuffer references to
    AudioWorkletProcessor.
  1. [AWGS] AudioWorkletProcessor notifies AudioWorkletNode that the setup is
    completed.

Once the initialization is completed, `AudioWorkletProcessor.process()` starts
to get called. The following is what should happen in each iteration of the
rendering loop.

##### Rendering Loop

<figure>
  <img
      class="diagram"
      src="/web/updates/images/2018/06/aw-design-pattern-7.png">
  <figcaption>
    Multi-threaded rendering with SharedArrayBuffers
  </figcaption>
</figure>

  1. [AWGS] `AudioWorkletProcessor.process(inputs, outputs)` gets called for
    every render quantum.
    1. `inputs` will be pushed into **Input SAB**.
    1. `outputs` will be filled by consuming audio data in **Output SAB**.
    1. Updates **States SAB** with new buffer indexes accordingly.
    1. If **Output SAB** gets close to underflow threshold, Wake Worker to
      render more audio data.
  1. [DWGS] Worker waits (sleeps) for the wake signal from
    `AudioWorkletProcessor.process()`. When it wakes up:
    1. Fetches buffer indexes from **States SAB**.
    1. Run the process function with data from **Input SAB** to fill
      **Output SAB**.
    1. Updates **States SAB** with buffer indexes accordingly.
    1. Goes to sleep and wait for the next signal.

The example code can be found here, but note that the SharedArrayBuffer
experimental flag must be enabled for this demo to work. The code was written
with pure JS code for simplicity, but it can be replaced with WebAssembly code
if needed. Such case should be handled with extra care by wrapping memory
management with
[HeapAudioBuffer](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/gh-pages/audio-worklet/design-pattern/lib/wasm-audio-helper.js#L37)
class.

## Conclusion

The ultimate goal of the Audio Worklet is to make the Web Audio API truly
"extensible". A multi-year effort went into its design to make it possible to
implement the rest of Web Audio API with the Audio Worklet. In turn, now we have
higher complexity in its design and this can be an unexpected challenge.

Fortunately, the reason for such complexity is purely to empower developers.
Being able to run WebAssembly on AudioWorkletGlobalScope unlocks huge potential
for high-performance audio processing on the web. For large-scale audio
applications written in C or C++, using an Audio Worklet with SharedArrayBuffers
and Workers can be an attractive option to explore.
