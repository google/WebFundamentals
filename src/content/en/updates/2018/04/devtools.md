Note: Check what version of Chrome you're running at `chrome://version`. If you're running
an earlier version, these features won't exist. If you're running a later version, these features
may have changed. Chrome auto-updates to a new major version about every 6 weeks.

## Search across all network headers and responses {: #network-search }

Open the **Network** panel then press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Mac) or
<kbd>Control</kbd>+F</kbd> (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the new **Network Search** pane.
DevTools searches the headers and bodies of all network requests for the query that you provide.

    Search pane
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Click **Match Case** ![Match Case][Case]{:.cdt-inl} to make your query case-sensitive. Click
**Use Regular Expression** ![Use Regular Expression][RegEx]{:.cdt-inl} to show any results that
match the pattern you provide. You don't need to wrap your RegEx in forward slashes.

### Search pane UI updates {: #search }

The UI of the **Global Search** pane now matches the UI of the new **Network Search** pane. It
now also pretty-prints results to aid scannability.

<figure>
  <img alt="The old and new UI."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/search-ui.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 3</b>. The old UI on the left, and the new UI on the right
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Mac) or
<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open **Global
Search**. You can also open it via the [Command Menu][CM].

## CSS variable value previews in the **Styles** pane {: #vars }

When the value of a CSS color property, such as `background-color` or `color`, is set to
a CSS variable, DevTools now shows a preview of that color.

<figure>
  <img alt="An example of CSS variable color values."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/vars.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 4</b>. In the old UI on the left, there is no color preview next to
    <code>color: var(--main-color)</code>, whereas in the new UI on the right, there is
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Copy as fetch {: #fetch }

Right-click a network request then select **Copy** > **Copy As Fetch** to copy the
`fetch()`-equivalent code for that request to your clipboard.

<figure>
  <img alt="Copying the fetch()-equivalent code for a request."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/fetch.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 5</b>. Copying the <code>fetch()</code>-equivalent code for a request
  </figcaption>
</figure>

DevTools produces code like the following:

    fetch("https://preload.glitch.me/styles.css", {
      "credentials": "omit",
      "headers": {},
      "referrer": "https://preload.glitch.me/after/",
      "referrerPolicy": "no-referrer-when-downgrade",
      "body": null,
      "method": "GET",
      "mode": "cors"
    });

## Audits panel updates {: #audits }

### New audits {: #new-audits }

The **Audits** panel has 2 new audits, including:

* [Preload key requests](/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/preload). Preloading requests can
  speed up page load time by giving hints to the browser to download resources that are important
  for your Critical Rendering Path as soon as possible.
* [Avoid invisible text while webfonts are loading](/web/updates/2016/02/font-display). Ensuring
  that text is visible while webfonts load makes the page more useful to users faster.

### New configuration options {: #audit-config }

You can now configure the **Audits** panel to:

* Preserve desktop viewport and user agent settings. In other words, you can prevent the **Audits**
  panel from simulating a mobile device.
* Disable network and CPU throttling.
* Preserve storage, such as LocalStorage and IndexedDB, across audits.

       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/audit-config.png"/>

</figure>

### View traces {: #traces }

After auditing a page, click **View Trace** to view the load performance data that your audit
is based off of in the **Performance** panel.

<figure>
  <img alt="The View Trace button."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/view-trace.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 7</b>. The <b>View Trace</b> button
  </figcaption>

## Stop infinite loops {: #stop }

If you work with `for` loops, `do...while` loops, or recursion a lot, you've probably executed
an infinite loop by mistake while developing your site. To stop the infinite loop, you can now:

1. Open the **Sources** panel.
1. Click **Pause** ![Pause][Pause]{: .cdt-inl }. The button changes to **Resume Script
   Execution** ![Resume][Resume]{:.cdt-inl}.
1. Hold **Resume Script Execution** ![Resume][Resume]{: .cdt-inl } then select **Stop Current
   JavaScript Call** ![Stop][Stop]{:.cdt-inl}.

[Pause]: /web/updates/images/2018/04/pause.png
[Resume]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/resume-script-execution.png
[Stop]: /web/updates/images/2018/04/stop.png

<div class="video-wrapper-full-width">
  <iframe class="devsite-embedded-youtube-video" data-video-id="haFYwEBjaTo"
          data-autohide="1" data-showinfo="0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

In the video above, the clock is being updated via a `setInterval()` timer. Clicking
**Start Infinite Loop** runs a `do...while` loop that never stops. The interval resumes because
it wasn't running when **Stop Current JavaScript Call** ![Stop][Stop]{:.cdt-inl} was selected.

## User Timing in the Performance tabs {: #tabs }

When viewing a Performance recording, click the **User Timing** section to view
[User Timing][UT]{:.external} measures in the **Summary**, **Bottom-Up**, **Call Tree** and
**Event Log** tabs.

[UT]: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webperformance/usertiming/

<figure>
  <img alt="Viewing User Timing measures in the Bottom-Up tab."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/bottom-up.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 8</b>. Viewing User Timing measures in the <b>Bottom-Up</b> tab. The blue bar
    to the left of the <b>User Timing</b> section indicates that it is selected.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In general, you can now select any of the sections (**Main Thread**, **User Timing**, **GPU**,
**ScriptStreamer**, and so on) and view that section's activity in the tabs.

## Select JavaScript VM instances in the Memory panel {: #vm }

The **Memory** panel now clearly lists out all JavaScript VM instances associated with a page,
rather than hiding them behind the **Target** dropdown menu as before.

<figure>
  <img alt="Before and after screenshots of the Memory panel."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/js-vm.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 9</b>. In the old UI on the left, the JavaScript VM instances are hidden behind
    the <b>Target</b> dropdown menu, whereas in the new UI on the right they are shown in the
    <b>Select JavaScript VM Instance</b> table
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Next to the `developers.google.com` instance there are 2 values: `8.7 MB` and `13.3 MB`.
The left value represents memory allocated because of JavaScript. The right value represents all
OS memory that is being allocated because of that VM instance. The right value is inclusive
of the left value. In Chrome's Task Manager, the left value corresponds to `JavaScript Memory`
and the right value corresponds to `Memory Footprint`.

## Network tab renamed to Page tab {: #page }

On the **Sources** panel, the **Network** tab is now called the **Page** tab.

<figure>
  <img alt="Two DevTools windows side-by-side, demonstrating the name change."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/page.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 10</b>. In the old UI on the left, the tab showing the page's resources is called
    <b>Network</b>, whereas in the new UI on the right it's called <b>Page</b>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Dark theme updates {: #dark }

Chrome 67 ships with a number of minor changes to the dark theme color scheme. For example,
the breakpoint icons and the current line of execution are now green.

<figure>
  <img alt="A screenshot of the new breakpoint icon and current line of execution color scheme."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/dark-theme.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 11</b>. A screenshot of the new breakpoint icon and current line of execution
    color scheme
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Certificate transparency in the Security panel {: #security }

The **Security** panel now reports [certificate transparency][transparency]{:.external}
information.

[transparency]: https://www.certificate-transparency.org/

<figure>
  <img alt="Certificate transparency information in the Security panel."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/certificate-transparency.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 12</b>. Certification transparency information in the Security panel
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Site Isolation in the Performance panel {: #site-isolation }

If you've got [Site Isolation][SI]{:.external} enabled, the **Performance** panel now provides
a flame chart for each process so that you can see the total work that each process is causing.

<figure>
  <img alt="Per-process flame charts in a Performance recording."
       src="/web/updates/images/2018/04/perf-isolation.png"/>

## Consider Canary {: #canary }

If you're on Mac or Windows, please consider using [Chrome Canary][canary] as your default
development browser. If you report a bug or a change that you don't like while it's still in
Canary, the DevTools team can address your feedback significantly faster.

Note: Canary is the bleeding-edge version of Chrome. It's released as soon as its built, without
testing. This means that Canary breaks from time-to-time, about once-a-month, and it's usually
fixed within a day. You can go back to using Chrome Stable while Canary is broken.
