* CSS manipulation becomes easier with the new [CSS Typed Model Object](#cssom).
* Access to the [clipboard](#async-clipboard) is now asynchronous.
* There’s a new [rendering context](#css-paint-api) for canvas elements.

And there’s [plenty more](#more)!

I’m Pete LePage. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 66!

Note: Want the full list of changes? Check out the
[Chromium source repository change list](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+log/65.0.3325.146..66.0.3359.116).


## CSS Typed Object Model {: #cssom }

If you’ve ever updated a CSS property via JavaScript, you’ve used the CSS
object model. But it returns everything as a string.

```javascript
el.style.opacity = 0.3;
console.log(typeof el.style.opacity);
> 'string' // A string!?
```

To animate the `opacity` property, I’d have to cast the string to a number,
then increment the value and apply my changes. Not exactly ideal.

```javascript
function step(timestamp) {
  const currentOpacity = parseFloat(el.style.opacity);
  const newOpacity = currentOpacity + 0.01;
  element.style.opacity = newOpacity;
  if (newOpacity <= 1) {
    window.requestAnimationFrame(step);
  }
}
```

With the new CSS Typed Object Model, CSS values are exposed as typed
JavaScript objects, eliminating a lot of the type manipulation, and providing
a more sane way of working with CSS.

Instead of using `element.style`, you access styles through the
`.attributeStyleMap` property or `.styleMap`. They return a map-like object
that makes it easy to read or update.

```javascript
el.attributeStyleMap.set('opacity', 0.3);
const oType = typeof el.attributeStyleMap.get('opacity').value;
console.log(oType);
> 'number' // Yay!
```

Compared to the old CSS Object Model, early benchmarks show about a 30%
improvement in operations per second - something that’s especially important
for JavaScript animations.

```javascript
el.attributeStyleMap.set('opacity', 0.3);
el.attributeStyleMap.has('opacity'); // true
el.attributeStyleMap.delete('opacity');
el.attributeStyleMap.clear(); // remove all styles
```

It also helps to eliminate bugs caused by forgetting to cast the value from a
string to a number, and it automatically handles rounding and clamping of
values. Plus, there’s some pretty neat new methods for dealing with unit
conversions, arithmetic and equality.

```javascript
el.style.opacity = 3;
const opacity = el.computedStyleMap().get('opacity').value;
console.log(opacity);
> 1
```

Eric has a great post with several demos and examples in his
[explainer](/web/updates/2018/03/cssom).


## Async Clipboard API {: #async-clipboard }

```javascript
const successful = document.execCommand('copy');
```

Synchronous copy & paste using `document.execCommand` can be OK for small
bits of text, but for anything else, there’s a good chance it’s synchronous
nature will block the page, causing a poor experience for the user. And the
permission model between browsers is inconsistent.

The new Async Clipboard API is a replacement that works asynchronously, and
integrates with the permission API to provide a better experience for users.

Text can be copied to the clipboard by calling `writeText()`.

```javascript
navigator.clipboard.writeText('Copy me!')
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Text is on the clipboard.');
  });
```

Since this API is asynchronous, the `writeText()` function returns a Promise
that will be resolved or rejected depending on whether the text we passed
is copied successfully.

Similarly, text can be read from the clipboard by calling `getText()` and
waiting for the returned Promise to resolve with the text.

```javascript
navigator.clipboard.getText()
  .then((text) => {
    console.log('Clipboard: ', text);
  });
```

Check out Jason’s post and demos in the
[explainer](/web/updates/2018/03/clipboardapi).
He’s also got examples that use `async` functions.


##  New Canvas Context `BitmapRenderer` {: #css-paint-api }

The `canvas` element lets you manipulate graphics at the pixel level, you
can draw graphs, manipulate photos, or even do real time video processing.
But, unless you’re starting with a blank `canvas`, you need a way to render
an image on the `canvas`.

Historically, that’s meant creating an `image` tag, then rendering it’s
contents on to the `canvas`. Unfortunately that means the browser needs to
store multiple copies of the image in memory.

```javascript
const context = el.getContext('2d');
const img = new Image();
img.onload = function () {
  context.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
}
img.src = 'llama.png';
```

Starting in Chrome 66, there’s a new asynchronous rendering context that’s
streamlined the display of `ImageBitmap` objects. They now render more
efficiently and with less jank by working asynchronously and avoiding memory
duplication.

To use it:

1. Call `createImageBitmap` and hand it an image blob, to create the image.
2. Grab the `bitmaprenderer` context from the `canvas`.
3. Then transfer the image in.

```javascript
const image = await createImageBitmap(imageBlob);
const context = el.getContext('bitmaprenderer');
context.transferFromImageBitmap(image);
```

Done, I’ve rendered the image!

## AudioWorklet {: #audio-worklet }

Worklets are in! PaintWorklet shipped in Chrome 65, and now we’re enabling
[AudioWorklet](/web/updates/2017/12/audio-worklet)
by default in Chrome 66. This new type of Worklet can be used to process
audio in the dedicated audio thread, replacing the legacy ScriptProcessorNode
which ran on the main thread.  Each AudioWorklet runs in its own global scope,
reducing latency and increasing throughput stability.

There are some interesting examples of AudioWorklet over on
[Google Chrome Labs](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/).

## And more! {: #more }

These are just a few of the changes in Chrome 66 for developers, of course,
there’s plenty more.

* `TextArea` and `Select` now support the `autocomplete` attribute.
* Setting `autocapitalize` on a `form` element will apply to any child form
  fields, improving compatibility with Safari’s implementation of
  `autocapitalize`.
* `trimStart()` and `trimEnd()` are now available as the standards-based way
  of trimming whitespace from strings.
