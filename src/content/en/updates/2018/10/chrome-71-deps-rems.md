Chrome 71 also includes changes to `cache.addAll()` and `importScripts()`. Read
about it in [Tweaks to `cache.addAll()` and `importScripts()` coming in Chrome
71](/web/updates/2018/10/tweaks-to-addAll-importScripts) by Jeff Posnick.

## Remove SpeechSynthesis.speak() without user activation

The [`SpeechSynthesis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis)
interface is actively being abused on the web. There's anecdotal evidences that
because other autoplay avenues are being closed, abuse is moving to the [Web
Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API),
which doesn't follow autoplay rules.

The `speechSynthesis.speak()` function now throws an error if the document has
not received a user activation. This feature has been deprecated since Chrome 70.

## Remove prefixed versions of APIs

Chrome has removed non-standard aliases for two widely supported standard
interfaces.

### WebKitAnimationEvent

`WebKitAnimationEvent` has been fully replaced by
[`AnimationEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnimationEvent)
, the event interface used for events relating to CSS Animations. The prefixed
form is only supported in Safari. Firefox and Edge only support the un-prefixed
`AnimationEvent`.

### WebKitTransitionEvent

`WebKitTransitionEvent` has been fully replaced by
[`TransitionEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransitionEvent)
, the event interface used for events relating to CSS Transitions (for example,
`transitionstart`). The prefixed form is only supported in Safari. Firefox and
Edge only support the un-prefixed `TransitionEvent`.

## Remove URL.createObjectURL from MediaStream

The `URL.createObjectURL()` method has been removed from the `MediaStream`
interface. This method has been deprecated in 2013 and superseded by assigning
streams to
[`HTMLMediaElement.srcObject`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/srcObject).
The old method was removed because it is less safe, requiring a call to
`URL.revokeOjbectURL()` to end the stream. Other user agents have either
deprecated (Firefox) or removed (Safari) this feature feature.

## Remove document.origin

The `document.origin` property has been removed. This property was only ever
implemented in Chromium and WebKit. It is redundant with `self.origin` which
can be used in [both window and worker
contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/origin)
and has wider support.
