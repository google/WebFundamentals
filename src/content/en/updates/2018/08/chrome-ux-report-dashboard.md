Continuous performance monitoring is crucial to identify trends and
regressions before they negatively affect your site engagement and bottom line
metrics. The
[Chrome UX Report](/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/)
(CrUX) enables you to track user experience and performance metrics for
millions of origins -- and yes, you can even compare competitors' performance
head-to-head! Today we're releasing the **CrUX Dashboard** that you can use to
better understand how an origin's performance evolves. It's built on
[Data Studio](https://cloud.google.com/data-studio/) and automatically syncs
with the latest datasets and can be easily customized and shared with everyone
on your team.

Go try it out at [g.co/chromeuxdash](https://g.co/chromeuxdash) -- it only
takes a minute to set it up! There are a few one-time confirmation prompts, so
if you have any hesitation refer to this helpful walkthrough video:

There are now three ways to explore the Chrome UX Report dataset, so let's see
what makes this one so special.

1. [BigQuery](/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/getting-started) is
great for slicing and dicing the raw data at will across any number of
origins. You get 1 TB of querying for
[free](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#free-tier) each month and a
billing account is required to cover any overages.

2. [PageSpeed Insights](/speed/pagespeed/insights/) allows you to explore the
latest snapshot of the user experience for a single URL or origin. You can see
how the page load performance is distributed in a web interface or API.

3. The [CrUX Dashboard](https://g.co/chromeuxdash) enables you to see how the
user experience of an origin changes over time. All of the data querying and
visualizing is done for you with unlimited free usage and the data is
automatically updated for you.

This dashboard is built on [Data Studio](https://cloud.google.com/data-studio/)
, Google's dashboarding and reporting platform that is free to use. Under the
hood, the entire data pipeline is managed for you thanks to the Chrome UX
Report's [community connector](/datastudio/connector/). All you need to do is
enter an origin and it will load the data and generate the visualizations for
you. It's even open source, so you can explore how it works in the
[GoogleDataStudio/community-connectors](https://github.com/googledatastudio/community-connectors/tree/master/chrome-ux-report)
repository on GitHub.

In this release we've set you up with three charts:

1. First Contentful Paint
2. Device Distribution
3. Connection Distribution

Each chart includes historical data so you can see how the distribution
changes over time. And this really is a live dashboard; the visualizations
will automatically update after each monthly release.

Some features we're exploring for future improvements are more metrics like
[First Input Delay](/web/updates/2018/07/first-input-delay-in-crux),
better error handling of unrecognized origins, and the ability to compare
multiple origins. If you have any suggestions to make the dashboard even
better, we'd love to hear from you on the
[forum](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/chrome-ux-report)
or
