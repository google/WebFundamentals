# Deprecations and removals in Chrome 69 {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/josephmedley.html" %}

Chrome 69 also removed the `stalled` event from `HTMLMediaElements`. You'll
find the explanation in [Audio/Video Updates in Chrome
69](web/updates/2018/08/chrome-69-media-updates#stalled) by Fran√ßois Beaufort.

## Removal of document.createTouchList()

The `TouchEvent()` constructor has been
[supported in Chrome](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/TouchEvent#Browser_compatibility)
since version 48. To comply with the specification, `document.createTouchList()`
is now removed. The `document.createTouch()` method was removed in Chrome 68.

## The window.confirm() method no longer activates its parent tab

Calling `window.confirm()` on a background tab will no longer activate that
tab. If it is called on a background tab, the function returns immediately with
`false` and no dialog box is shown to the user. If the tab is active, the call
behaves as usual.

The `window.alert()` method was abused by sites for years, allowing them to
force themselves to the front, disrupting whatever the user was doing. There
was a similar problem with `window.prompt()`. Because these behaviors were
removed in Chrome 64, and 56 respectively, the abuse has been moving to
`window.confirm()`.
