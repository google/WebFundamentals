`BigInt`s are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary
precision. With `BigInt`s, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe
integer limit for `Number`s. This article walks through some use cases and explains the new
functionality in Chrome 67 by comparing `BigInt`s to `Number`s in JavaScript.

## Use cases

Arbitrary-precision integers unlock lots of new use cases for JavaScript.

`BigInt`s make it possible to correctly perform integer arithmetic without overflowing. That by
itself enables countless new possibilities. Mathematical operations on large numbers are commonly
used in financial technology, for example.

[Large integer IDs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/twitter-ids) and [high-accuracy
timestamps](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20220) cannot safely be represented as `Number`s in
JavaScript. This [often](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/1399) leads to
[real-world bugs](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/12115), and causes JavaScript developers to
represent them as strings instead. With `BigInt`, this data can now be represented as numeric
values.

`BigInt` could form the basis of an eventual `BigDecimal` implementation. This would be useful to
represent sums of money with decimal precision, and to accurately operate on them (a.k.a. the
`0.10 + 0.20 !== 0.30` problem).

Previously, JavaScript applications with any of these use cases had to resort to userland libraries
that emulate `BigInt`-like functionality. When `BigInt` becomes widely available, such applications
can drop these run-time dependencies in favor of native `BigInt`s. This helps reduce load time,
parse time, and compile time, and on top of all that offers significant run-time performance
improvements.

‚ÄúPolyfilling‚Äù `BigInt`s requires a run-time library that implements similar functionality, as well
as a transpilation step to turn the new syntax into a call to the library‚Äôs API. Babel currently
supports parsing `BigInt` literals through a plugin, but doesn‚Äôt transpile them. As such, we don‚Äôt
expect `BigInt`s to be used in production sites that require broad cross-browser compatibility just
yet. It‚Äôs still early days, but now that the functionality is starting to ship in browsers, you can
start to experiment with `BigInt`s. Expect wider `BigInt` support soon.

## The status quo: `Number` {: #number }

`Number`s in JavaScript are represented as [double-precision
floats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic). This means they have limited
precision. The `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` constant gives the greatest possible integer that can
safely be incremented. Its value is `2**53-1`.

```js
const max = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
// ‚Üí 9_007_199_254_740_991
```

Note: For readability, I‚Äôm grouping the digits in this large number per thousand, using underscores
as separators. [The numeric literal separators
proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-numeric-separator) enables exactly that for common
JavaScript numeric literals.

Incrementing it once gives the expected result:

```js
max + 1;
// ‚Üí 9_007_199_254_740_992 ‚úÖ
```

But if we increment it a second time, the result is no longer exactly representable as a JavaScript
`Number`:

```js
max + 2;
// ‚Üí 9_007_199_254_740_992 ‚ùå
```

Note how `max + 1` produces the same result as `max + 2`. Whenever we get this particular value in
JavaScript, there is no way to tell whether it‚Äôs accurate or not. Any calculation on integers
outside the safe integer range (i.e. from `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`)
potentially loses precision. For this reason, we can only rely on numeric integer values within
the safe range.

## The new hotness: `BigInt` {: #bigint }

`BigInt`s are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with [arbitrary
precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic). With `BigInt`s, you can
safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for `Number`s.

To create a `BigInt`, add the `n` suffix to any integer literal. For example, `123` becomes `123n`.
The global `BigInt(number)` function can be used to convert a `Number` into a `BigInt`. In other
words, `BigInt(123) === 123n`. Let‚Äôs use these two techniques to solve the problem we were having
earlier:

```js
BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) + 2n;
// ‚Üí 9_007_199_254_740_993n ‚úÖ
```

Here‚Äôs another example, where we‚Äôre multiplying two `Number`s:

```js
1234567890123456789 * 123;
// ‚Üí 151851850485185200000 ‚ùå
```

Looking at the least significant digits, `9` and `3`, we know that the result of the multiplication
should end in `7` (because `9 * 3 === 27`). However, the result ends in a bunch of zeroes. That
can‚Äôt be right! Let‚Äôs try again with `BigInt`s instead:

```js
1234567890123456789n * 123n;
// ‚Üí 151851850485185185047n ‚úÖ
```

This time we get the correct result.

The safe integer limits for `Number`s don‚Äôt apply to `BigInt`s. Therefore, with `BigInt` we can
perform correct integer arithmetic without having to worry about losing precision.

### A new primitive

`BigInt`s are a new primitive in the JavaScript language. As such, they get their own type that can
be detected using the `typeof` operator:

```js
typeof 123;
// ‚Üí 'number'
typeof 123n;
// ‚Üí 'bigint'
```

Because `BigInt`s are a separate type, a `BigInt` is never strictly equal to a `Number`, e.g.
`42n !== 42`. To compare a `BigInt` to a `Number`, convert one of them into the other‚Äôs type before
doing the comparison or use abstract equality (`==`):

```js
42n === BigInt(42);
// ‚Üí true
42n == 42;
// ‚Üí true
```

When coerced into a boolean (which happens when using `if`, `&&`, `||`, or `Boolean(int)`, for
example), `BigInt`s follow the same logic as `Number`s.

```js
if (0n) {
  console.log('if');
} else {
  console.log('else');
}
// ‚Üí logs 'else', because `0n` is falsy.
```

### Operators

`BigInt`s support the most common operators. Binary `+`, `-`, `*`, and `**` all work as expected.
`/` and `%` work, and round towards zero as needed. Bitwise operations `|`, `&`,
<code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, and `^` perform bitwise arithmetic assuming a [two‚Äôs
complement representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) for negative values,
just like they do for `Number`s.

```js
(7 + 6 - 5) * 4 ** 3 / 2 % 3;
// ‚Üí 1
(7n + 6n - 5n) * 4n ** 3n / 2n % 3n;
// ‚Üí 1n
```

Unary `-` can be used to denote a negative `BigInt` value, e.g. `-42n`. Unary `+` is _not_
supported because it would break asm.js code which expects `+x` to always produce either a
`Number` or an exception.

One gotcha is that it‚Äôs not allowed to mix operations between `BigInt`s and `Number`s. This is a
good thing, because any implicit coercion could lose information. Consider this example:

```js
BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) + 2.5;
// ‚Üí ?? ü§î
```

What should the result be? There is no good answer here. `BigInt`s can‚Äôt represent fractions, and
`Number`s can‚Äôt represent `BigInt`s beyond the safe integer limit. For that reason, mixing
operations between `BigInt`s and `Number`s results in a `TypeError` exception.

The only exception to this rule are comparison operators such as `===` (as discussed earlier),
`<`, and `>=` ‚Äì because they return booleans, there is no risk of precision loss.

```js
1 + 1n;
// ‚Üí TypeError
123 < 124n;
// ‚Üí true
```

Note: Because `BigInt`s and `Number`s generally don‚Äôt mix, please avoid overloading or magically
"upgrading" your existing code to use `BigInt`s instead of `Number`s. Decide which of these two
domains to operate in, and then stick to it. For _new_ APIs that operate on potentially large
integers, `BigInt` is the best choice. `Number`s still make sense for integer values that are
known to be in the safe integer range.

Another thing to note is that [the `>>>`
operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Unsigned_right_shift),
which performs an unsigned right shift, does not make sense for `BigInt`s since they‚Äôre always
signed. For this reason, `>>>` does not work for `BigInt`s.

### API

Several new `BigInt`-specific APIs are available.

The global `BigInt` constructor is similar to the `Number` constructor: it converts its argument
into a `BigInt` (as mentioned earlier). If the conversion fails, it throws a `SyntaxError` or
`RangeError` exception.

```js
BigInt(123);
// ‚Üí 123n
BigInt(1.5);
// ‚Üí RangeError
BigInt('1.5');
// ‚Üí SyntaxError
```

Two library functions enable wrapping `BigInt` values as either signed or unsigned integers,
limited to a specific number of bits. `BigInt.asIntN(width, value)` wraps a `BigInt` value to a
`width`-digit binary signed integer, and `BigInt.asUintN(width, value)` wraps a `BigInt` value to
a `width`-digit binary unsigned integer. If you‚Äôre doing 64-bit arithmetic for example, you can use
these APIs to stay within the appropriate range:

```js
// Highest possible BigInt value that can be represented as a
// signed 64-bit integer.
const max = 2n ** (64n - 1n) - 1n;
BigInt.asIntN(64, max);
‚Üí 9223372036854775807n
BigInt.asIntN(64, max + 1n);
// ‚Üí -9223372036854775808n
//   ^ negative because of overflow
```

Note how overflow occurs as soon as we pass a `BigInt` value exceeding the 64-bit integer range
(i.e. 63 bits for the absolute numeric value + 1 bit for the sign).

`BigInt`s make it possible to accurately represent 64-bit signed and unsigned integers, which are
commonly used in other programming languages. Two new typed array flavors, `BigInt64Array` and
`BigUint64Array`, make it easier to efficiently represent and operate on lists of such values:

```js
const view = new BigInt64Array(4);
// ‚Üí [0n, 0n, 0n, 0n]
view.length;
// ‚Üí 4
view[0];
// ‚Üí 0n
view[0] = 42n;
view[0];
// ‚Üí 42n
```

The `BigInt64Array` flavor ensures that its values remain within the signed 64-bit limit.

```
// Highest possible BigInt value that can be represented as a
// signed 64-bit integer.
const max = 2n ** (64n - 1n) - 1n;
view[0] = max;
view[0];
// ‚Üí 9_223_372_036_854_775_807n
view[0] = max + 1n;
view[0];
// ‚Üí -9_223_372_036_854_775_808n
//   ^ negative because of overflow
```

The `BigUint64Array` flavor does the same using the unsigned 64-bit limit instead.

## Polyfilling and transpiling BigInts

At the time of writing, `BigInt`s are only supported in Chrome. Other browsers are actively working
on implementing them. But what if you want to use `BigInt` functionality *today* without
sacrificing browser compatibility? I‚Äôm glad you asked! The answer is‚Ä¶ interesting, to say the least.

Unlike most other modern JavaScript features, `BigInt`s cannot reasonably be transpiled down to ES5.

The `BigInt` proposal [changes the behavior of operators](#operators) (like `+`, `>=`, etc.) to
work on `BigInt`s. These changes are impossible to polyfill directly; and they are also making it
infeasible (in most cases) to transpile `BigInt` code to fallback code using Babel or similar
tools. The reason is that such a transpilation would have to replace *every single operator* in the
program with a call to some function that performs type checks on its inputs, which would incur an
unacceptable run-time performance penalty. In addition, it would greatly increase the file size of
any transpiled bundle, negatively impacting download, parse, and compile times.

A more feasible and future-proof solution is to write your code using [the JSBI
library](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi#why) for now. JSBI is a JavaScript port of the
`BigInt` implementation in V8 and Chrome ‚Äî by design, it behaves exactly like the native `BigInt`
functionality. The difference is that instead of relying on syntax, it exposes [an
API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi#how):

```js
import JSBI from './jsbi.mjs';

const max = JSBI.BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
const two = JSBI.BigInt('2');
const result = JSBI.add(max, two);
console.log(result.toString());
// ‚Üí '9007199254740993'
```

Once `BigInt`s are natively supported in all browsers you care about, you can [use
`babel-plugin-transform-jsbi-to-bigint` to transpile your code to native `BigInt`
code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/babel-plugin-transform-jsbi-to-bigint) and drop the JSBI
dependency. For example, the above example transpiles to:

```js
const max = BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
const two = 2n;
const result = max + two;
console.log(result);
// ‚Üí '9007199254740993'
```
