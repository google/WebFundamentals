## Let's talk about... architecture?

I'm going to cover an important, but potentially misunderstood topic: The
architecture that you use for your web app, and specifically, how your
architectural decisions come into play when you're building a progressive web
app.

"Architecture" can sound vague, and it may not be immediately clear why this
matters. Well, one way to think about architecture is to ask yourself the
following questions: When a user visits a page on my site, what HTML is loaded?
And then, what's loaded when they visit another page?

The answers to those questions are not always straightforward, and once you
start thinking about progressive web apps, they can get even more complicated.
So my goal is to walk you through one possible architecture that I found
effective. Throughout this article, I'll label the decisions that I made as
being "my approach" to building a progressive web app.

You're free to use my approach when building your own PWA, but at the same time,
there are always other valid alternatives. My hope is that seeing how all the
pieces fit together will inspire you, and that you will feel empowered to
customize this to suit your needs.

## Stack Overflow PWA

To accompany this article I built a [Stack Overflow
PWA](https://so-pwa.firebaseapp.com/). I spend a lot of time reading and
[contributing](https://stackoverflow.com/users/385997/jeff-posnick) to [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and I wanted to build a web app that
would make it easy to browse frequently asked questions for a given topic. It's
built on top of the public [Stack Exchange
API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs). It's open source, and you can learn
more [by visiting the GitHub
project](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa).

## Multi-page Apps (MPAs)

Before I get into specifics, let's define some
terms and explain pieces of underlying technology. First, I'm going to be
covering what I like to call "Multi Page Apps", or "MPAs".

MPA is a fancy name for the traditional architecture used
since this beginning of the web. Each time a user navigates to a new URL, the
browser progressively renders HTML specific to that page. There's no attempt to
preserve the page's state or the content in between navigations. Each time you
visit a new page, you're starting fresh.

This is in contrast to the [single-page
app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) model for
building web apps, in which the browser runs JavaScript code to update the
existing page when the user visits a new section. Both SPAs and MPAs are equally
valid models to use, but for this post, I wanted to explore PWA concepts within
the context of a multi-page app.

## Reliably fast

You've heard me (and countless others) use the phrase "progressive web
app", or PWA. You might already be familiar with some of the background
material, [elsewhere on this
site](/web/progressive-web-apps/).

You can think of a PWA as a web app that provides a first-class user experience,
and that truly earns a place on the user's home screen. The acronym "**FIRE**",
standing for **F**ast, **I**ntegrated, **R**eliable, and **E**ngaging, sums up
all the attributes to think about when building a PWA.

In this article, I'm going to focus on a subset of those attributes: **Fast**
and **Reliable**.

**Fast:**
While "fast" means different things in different contexts, I'm going to
cover the speed benefits of loading as little as possible from the network.

**Reliable:**
But raw speed isn't enough. In order to feel like a PWA, your web app should be
reliable. It needs to be resilient enough to always load something, even if it's
just a customized error page, regardless of the state of the network.

**Reliably fast:**
And finally, I'm going to rephrase the PWA definition slightly and look at what
it means to build something that's reliably fast. It's not good enough to be
fast and reliable only when you're on a low-latency network. Being reliably fast
means that your web app's speed is consistent, regardless of the underlying
network conditions.

## Enabling Technologies: Service Workers + Cache Storage API

PWAs introduce a high bar for speed and resilience. Fortunately, the web
platform offers some building blocks to make that type of performance a reality.
I'm referring to [service workers](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/)
and the [Cache Storage
API](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api).

You can build a service worker that listens for incoming requests, passing some
on to the network, and storing a copy of the response for future use, via the
Cache Storage API.

<img alt="A service worker using the Cache Storage API to save a copy of a
          network response."
     src="/web/updates/2018/05/images/beyond-spa/sw-overview-1.png">

The next time the web app makes the same request, its service worker can check
its caches and just return the previously cached response.

<img alt="A service worker using the Cache Storage API to respond, bypassing
          the network."
     src="/web/updates/2018/05/images/beyond-spa/sw-overview-2.png">

Avoiding the network whenever possible is a crucial part of offering reliably
fast performance.

## "Isomorphic" JavaScript

One more concept that I want to cover is what's sometimes referred to as
["isomorphic", or "universal"
JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript). Simply put,
it's the idea that the same JavaScript code can be shared between different
runtime environments. When I built my PWA, I wanted to share JavaScript code
between my back-end server, and the service worker.

There are lots of valid approaches to sharing code in this way, but **my
approach** was to use [ES
modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) as
the definitive source code. I then transpiled and bundled those modules for the
server and the service worker using a combination of
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/). In my project,
files with an `.mjs` file extension is code that lives in an ES module.

## The server

Keeping those concepts and terminology in mind, let's dive into how I actually
built my Stack Overflow PWA. I'm going to start by covering our backend
server, and explain how that fits into the overall architecture.

I was looking for a combination of a dynamic backend along with static hosting,
and my approach was to use the Firebase platform.

[Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) will
automatically spin up a Node-based environment when there's an incoming request,
and integrate with the popular [Express HTTP
framework](https://expressjs.com/), which I was already familiar with. It also
offers out-of-the-box [hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) for
all of my site's static resources. Let's take a look at how the server handles
requests.

When a browser makes a navigation request against our server, it goes through
the following flow:

<img alt="An overview of generating a navigation response, server-side."
     src="/web/updates/2018/05/images/beyond-spa/server-diagram.png">

The server routes the request based on the URL, and uses templating logic to
create a complete HTML document. I use a combination of data from the Stack
Exchange API, as well as partial HTML fragments that the server stores locally.
Once our service worker knows how to respond, it can start streaming HTML back
to our web app.

There are two pieces of this picture worth exploring in more detail: routing,
and templating.

### Routing

When it comes to routing, my approach was to use the Express framework's [native
routing syntax](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). It's flexible
enough to match simple URL prefixes, as well as URLs that include parameters as
part of the path. Here, I [create a
mapping](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/lib/routes.mjs)
between route names the underlying Express pattern to match against.

```js
const routes = new Map([
  ['about', '/about'],
  ['questions', '/questions/:questionId'], ['index', '/'],
]);

export default routes;
```

I can then reference this mapping directly from the [server's
code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/server.mjs).
When there's a match for a given Express pattern, the appropriate handler
responds with templating logic specific to the matching route.

```js
import routes from './lib/routes.mjs';
app.get(routes.get('index'), async (req, res) => {
  // Templating logic.
});
```

### Server-side templating

And what does that templating logic look like? Well, I went with an approach
that pieced together partial HTML fragments in sequence, one after another. This
model lends itself well to streaming.

The server sends back some initial HTML boilerplate immediately, and the browser
is able to render that partial page right away. As the server pieces together
the rest of the data sources, it streams them to the browser until the
document is complete.

To see what I mean, take a look at the [Express
code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/server.mjs) for
one of our routes:

```js
app.get(routes.get('index'), async (req, res) => {
  res.write(headPartial + navbarPartial);
  const tag = req.query.tag || DEFAULT_TAG;
  const data = await requestData(...);
  res.write(templates.index(tag, data.items));
  res.write(footPartial);
  res.end();
});
```

By using the `response` object's [`write()`
method](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_write_chunk_encoding_callback),
and referencing locally stored partial templates, I'm able to start the
response [stream](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook) immediately,
without blocking any external data source. The browser takes this initial
HTML and renders a meaningful interface and loading message right away.

The next portion of our page uses data from the [Stack Exchange
API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs). Getting that data means that our
server needs to make a network request. The web app can't render anything else
until it gets a response back and process it, but at least users aren't staring
at a blank screen while they wait.

Once the web app's received the response from the Stack Exchange API, it calls a
custom templating function to translate the data from the API into its
corresponding HTML.

### Templating language

Templating can be a surprisingly contentious topic, and what I went with is just
one approach among many. You'll want to substitute your own solution, especially
if you have legacy ties to an existing templating framework.

What made sense for my use case was to just rely on JavaScript's [template
literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals),
with some logic broken out into helper functions. One of the nice things about
building an MPA is that you don't have to keep track of state updates and
re-render your HTML, so a basic approach that produced static HTML worked for
me.

So here's an example of how I'm templating the dynamic HTML portion of my web
app's index. As with my routes, the templating logic is [stored in an ES
module](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/lib/templates.mjs)
that can be imported into both the server and the service worker.

```js
export function index(tag, items) {
  const title = `<h3>Top "${escape(tag)}" Questions</h3>`;
  const form = `<form method="GET">...</form>`;
  const questionCards = items.map((item) => questionCard({
    id: item.question_id,
    title: item.title,
  })).join('');
  const questions = `<div id="questions">${questionCards}</div>`;
  return title + form + questions;
}
```

Warning: Whenever you're taking user-provided input and converting it to HTML,
it's [crucial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) that you take
care to properly escape potentially dangerous character sequences. If you're
using an existing templating solution rather than rolling your own, that might
already be [taken care
of](https://security.googleblog.com/2009/03/reducing-xss-by-way-of-automatic.html)
for you.

These template functions are pure JavaScript, and it's useful to break out the
logic into smaller, helper functions when appropriate. Here, I pass each of the
items returned in the API response into one such function, which creates a
standard HTML element with all of the appropriate attributes set.

```js
function questionCard({id, title}) {
  return `<a class="card"
             href="/questions/${id}"
             data-cache-url="${questionUrl(id)}">${title}</a>`;
}
```

<span id="data-attribute-anchor">Of particular note</span> is a [data
attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*)
that I add to each link, `data-cache-url`, set to the Stack Exchange API URL
that I need in order to display the corresponding question. Keep that in
mind. I'll revisit it later.

Jumping back to my [route
handler](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/server.mjs),
once templating is complete, I stream the final portion of my page's HTML to the
browser, and end the stream. This is the cue to the browser that the progressive
rendering is complete.

```js
app.get(routes.get('index'), async (req, res) => {
  res.write(headPartial + navbarPartial);
  const tag = req.query.tag || DEFAULT_TAG;
  const data = await requestData(...);
  res.write(templates.index(tag, data.items));
  res.write(footPartial);
  res.end();
});
```

So that's a brief tour of my server setup. Users who visit my web app for the
first time will always get a response from the server, but when a visitor
returns to my web app, my [service
worker](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) will start responding. Let's
dive in there.

## The service worker

<img alt="An overview of generating a navigation response, in the service
          worker."
     src="/web/updates/2018/05/images/beyond-spa/sw-diagram.png">

This diagram should look familiar—many of the same pieces I've previously
covered are here in a slightly different arrangement. Let's walk through
the request flow, taking the service worker into account.

Our service worker handles an incoming navigation request for a given URL,
and just like my server did, it uses a combination of routing and
templating logic to figure out how to respond.

The approach is the same as before, but with different low-level primitives,
like [`fetch()`](/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch) and the [Cache
Storage API](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api). I use
those data sources to construct the HTML response, which the service worker
passes back to the web app.

### Workbox

Rather than starting from scratch with low-level primitives, I'm going to
build my service worker on top of a set of high-level libraries called
[Workbox](/web/tools/workbox/). It provides a solid
foundation for any service worker's caching, routing, and response generation
logic.

### Routing

Just as with my server-side code, my service worker needs to know how to match
an incoming request with the appropriate response logic.

My approach was to
[translate](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/lib/route-matchers.mjs)
each Express route into a corresponding [regular
expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions),
making use of a helpful library called
[`regexparam`](https://github.com/lukeed/regexparam). Once that translation is
performed, I can take advantage of Workbox's built-in support for [regular
expression
routing](/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-routing#how_to_register_a_regular_expression_route).

After importing the module that has the regular expressions, I register each
regular expression with Workbox's router. Inside each route I'm able to provide
custom templating logic to generate a response. Templating in the service worker
is a bit more involved than it was in my backend server, but Workbox helps with
a lot of the heavy lifting.

```js
import regExpRoutes from './regexp-routes.mjs';

workbox.routing.registerRoute(regExpRoutes.get('index'),
  // Templating logic.
);
```

### Static asset caching

One key part of the templating story is making sure that my partial HTML
templates are locally available via the Cache Storage API, and are kept up to
date when I deploy changes to the web app. Cache maintenance can be error prone
when done by hand, so I turn to Workbox to handle
[precaching](/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching) as part of my build
process.

I tell Workbox which URLs to precache using a [configuration
file](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/workbox-config.js),
pointing to the directory that contains all of my local assets along with a set
of patterns to match. This file is automatically read by the [Workbox's
CLI](/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli), which is
[run](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/blob/master/package.json) each
time I rebuild the site.

```js
module.exports = {
  globDirectory: 'build',
  globPatterns: ['**/*.{html,js,svg}'],
  // Other options...
};
```

Workbox takes a snapshot of each file's contents, and automatically injects that
list of URLs and revisions into my final service worker file. Workbox now has
everything it needs to make the precached files always available, and kept up to
date. The result is a [`service-worker.js`
file](https://so-pwa.firebaseapp.com/service-worker.js) that contains something
similar to the following:

```js
workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([
  {
    url: 'partials/about.html',
    revision: '518747aad9d7e'
  }, {
    url: 'partials/foot.html',
    revision: '69bf746a9ecc6'
  },
  // etc.
]);
```

For folks who use a more complex build process, Workbox has both a [`webpack`
plugin](/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin) and a [generic node
module](/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-build), in addition to its [command
line interface](/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli).

### Streaming

Next, I want the service worker to stream that precached partial HTML back to
the web app immediately. This is a crucial part of being
"reliably fast"—I always get something meaningful on the screen right away.
Fortunately, using the [Streams
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) within our
service worker makes that possible.

Now, you might have heard about the Streams API before. My colleague Jake
Archibald has been singing its praises for years. He made the [bold
prediction](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streams-ftw/) that 2016 would be the
year of web streams. And the Streams API is just as awesome today as it was two
years ago, but with a crucial difference.

While only Chrome supported Streams back then, the Streams API is [more
widely supported now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API#Browser_compatibility). The
overall story is positive, and with appropriate fallback code, there's nothing
stopping you from using streams in your service worker today.

Well... there might be one thing stopping you, and that's wrapping your head
around how the Streams API actually works. It exposes a very powerful set of
primitives, and developers who are comfortable using it can create complex data
flows, like the following:

```js
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  pull(controller) {
    return sources[0].then((r) => r.read())
    .then((result) => {
      if (result.done) {
        sources.shift();
        if (sources.length === 0) return controller.close();
        return this.pull(controller);
      } else {
        controller.enqueue(result.value);
      }
    })
  }
});
```

But understanding the full implications of this code might not be for
everyone. Rather than parse through this logic, let's talk about my approach
to service worker streaming.

I'm using a brand new, high-level wrapper,
[`workbox-streams`](/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/workbox.streams).
With it, I can pass it in a mix of streaming sources, both from caches and
runtime data that might come from the network. Workbox takes care of
coordinating the individual sources and stitching them together into a single,
streaming response.

Additionally, Workbox automatically detects whether the Streams API is
supported, and when it's not, it creates an equivalent, non-streaming response.
This means that you don't have to worry about writing fallbacks, as streams inch
closer to 100% browser support.

### Runtime caching

Let's check out how my [service
worker](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/service-worker.mjs)
deals with runtime data, from the Stack Exchange API. I'm making use of
Workbox's built-in support for a [stale-while-revalidate caching
strategy](/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/workbox.strategies#stalewhilerevalidate),
along with expiration to ensure that the web app's  storage doesn't grow
unbounded.

I set up two strategies in Workbox to handle the different sources that will
make up the streaming response. In a few function calls and configuration,
Workbox lets us do what would otherwise take hundreds of lines of handwritten
code.

```js
const cacheStrategy = workbox.strategies.cacheFirst({
  cacheName: workbox.core.cacheNames.precache,
});

const apiStrategy = workbox.strategies.staleWhileRevalidate({
  cacheName: API_CACHE_NAME,
  plugins: [
    new workbox.expiration.Plugin({maxEntries: 50}),
  ],
});
```

The first strategy reads data that's been precached, like our
partial HTML templates.

The other strategy implements the stale-while-revalidate caching logic,
along with least-recently-used cache expiration once we reach 50 entries.

Now that I have those strategies in place, all that's left is to [tell
Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/service-worker.mjs)
how to use them to construct a complete, streaming response. I pass in an array
of sources as functions, and each of those functions will be executed
immediately. Workbox takes the result from each source and streams it to the web
app, in sequence, only delaying if the next function in the array hasn't
completed yet.

```js
workbox.streams.strategy([
  () => cacheStrategy.makeRequest({request: '/head.html'}),
  () => cacheStrategy.makeRequest({request: '/navbar.html'}),
  async ({event, url}) => {
    const tag = url.searchParams.get('tag') || DEFAULT_TAG;
    const listResponse = await apiStrategy.makeRequest(...);
    const data = await listResponse.json();
    return templates.index(tag, data.items);
  },
  () => cacheStrategy.makeRequest({request: '/foot.html'}),
]);
```

The first two sources are precached partial templates read directly from the
Cache Storage API, so they'll always be available immediately. This ensures that
our service worker implementation will be reliably fast in responding to
requests, just like my server-side code.

Our next source function fetches data from the Stack Exchange API, and processes
the response into the HTML that the web app expects.

The stale-while-revalidate strategy means that if I have a previously cached
response for this API call, I'll be able to stream it to the page immediately,
while updating the cache entry "in the background" for the next time it's
requested.

Finally, I stream a cached copy of my footer and close the final HTML tags,
to complete the response.

### Sharing code keeps things in sync

You'll notice that certain bits of the service worker code look familiar. The
partial HTML and templating logic used by my service worker is identical to
what my server-side handler uses. This code sharing ensures that users get a
consistent experience, whether they're visiting my web app for the first time
or returning to a page rendered by the service worker. That's the beauty of
isomorphic JavaScript.

## Dynamic, progressive enhancements

I've walked through both the server and service worker for my PWA, but there's
one last bit of logic to cover: there's a [small amount of
JavaScript](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/app.mjs)
that runs on each of my pages, after they're fully streamed in.

This code progressively enhances the user experience, but isn't crucial—the web
app will still work if it's not run.

### Page metadata

My app uses client-side JavaScipt for to update a page's metadata based on the
API response. Because I use the same initial bit of cached HTML for each page,
the web app ends up with generic tags in my document's head. But through
coordination between my templating and client-side code, I can update the
window's title using page-specific metadata.

As part of the [templating
code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/lib/templates.mjs),
my approach is to include a script tag containing the properly escaped string.

```js
const metadataScript = `<script>
  self._title = '${escape(item.title)}';
</script>`;
```

Then, once my page [has
loaded](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/app.mjs), I
read that string and update the document title.

```js
if (self._title) {
  document.title = unescape(self._title);
}
```

If there are other pieces of page-specific metadata you want to update in your
own web app, you can follow the same approach.

### Offline UX

The other progressive enhancement I've added is used to bring attention to our
offline capabilities. I've built a reliable PWA, and I want users to know
that when they're offline, they can still load previously visited pages.

First, I use the Cache Storage API to get  a list of all the previously cached
API requests, and I translate that into a list of URLs.

Remember those special data attributes <a href="#data-attribute-anchor">I talked
about</a>, each containing the URL for the API request needed to display a
question? I can cross-reference those data attributes against the list of cached
URLs, and create an array of all the question links that don't match.

When the browser enters an offline state, [I loop
through](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/so-pwa/blob/master/src/app.mjs) the
list of uncached links, and dim out the ones that won't work. Keep in mind that
this is just a visual hint to the user about what they should expect from those
pages—I'm not actually disabling the links, or preventing the user from
navigating.

```js
const apiCache = await caches.open(API_CACHE_NAME);
const cachedRequests = await apiCache.keys();
const cachedUrls = cachedRequests.map((request) => request.url);

const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.card');
const uncachedCards = [...cards].filter((card) => {
  return !cachedUrls.includes(card.dataset.cacheUrl);
});

const offlineHandler = () => {
  for (const uncachedCard of uncachedCards) {
    uncachedCard.style.opacity = '0.3';
  }
};

const onlineHandler = () => {
  for (const uncachedCard of uncachedCards) {
    uncachedCard.style.opacity = '1.0';
  }
};

window.addEventListener('online', onlineHandler);
window.addEventListener('offline', offlineHandler);
```

## Common pitfalls

I've now gone through a tour of my approach to building a multi-page PWA.
There are many factors that you'll have to consider when coming up with your
own approach, and you may end up making different choices than I did. That
flexibility is one of the great things about building for the web.

There are a few common pitfalls that you may encounter when making your own
architectural decisions, and I want  to save you
some pain.

**Don't cache full HTML**

I recommend against storing complete HTML documents in your cache. For
one thing, it's a waste of space. If your web app uses the same basic HTML
structure for each of its pages, you'll end up storing copies of the same markup
again and again.

More importantly, if you deploy a change to your site's shared HTML structure,
every one of those previously cached pages is still stuck with your old layout.
Imagine the frustration of a returning visitor seeing a mix of old and new
pages.

**Server / service worker drift**

The other pitfall to avoid involves your server and service worker getting out
of sync. *My approach** was to use isomorphic JavaScript, so that the same code
was run in both places. Depending on your existing server architecture,
that's not always possible.

Whatever architectural decisions you make, you should have some
strategy for running the equivalent routing and templating code in your server
and your service worker.

## Worst case scenarios

**Inconsistent layout / design**

What happens when you ignore those pitfalls? Well, all sorts of failures are
possible, but the worst case scenario is that a returning user visits a cached
page with a very stale layout—perhaps one with out of date header text, or that
uses CSS class names that are no longer valid.

**Worst case scenario: Broken routing**

Alternatively, a user might come across a URL that's handled by your server, but
not your service worker. An site full of zombie layouts and dead ends is not a
reliable PWA.

## Tips for success

But you're not in this alone! The following tips can help you avoid those
pitfalls:

**Use templating and routing libraries that have multi-language implementations**

Try to use templating and routing libraries that have JavaScript
implementations. Now, I know that not every developer out there has the luxury
of migrating off your current web server and templating language.

But a number of popular templating and routing frameworks have implementations
in multiple languages. If you can find one that works with JavaScript as well as
your current server's language, you're one step closer to keeping your service
worker and server in sync.

**Prefer sequential, rather than nested, templates**

Next, I recommend using a series of sequential templates that can be streamed in
one after another. It's okay if later portions of your page use more complicated
templating logic, as long as you can stream in the initial part of your HTML as
quickly as possible.

**Cache both static and dynamic content in your service worker**

For best performance, you should precache all of your site's critical static
resources. You should also set up runtime caching logic to handle dynamic
content, like API requests. Using [Workbox](/web/tools/workbox/) means that you
can build on top of well-tested, production-ready strategies instead of
implementing it all from scratch.

**Only block on the network when absolutely necessary**

And related to that, you should only block on the network when it's not possible
to stream a response from the cache. Displaying a cached API response
immediately can often lead to a better user experience than waiting for fresh
data.
