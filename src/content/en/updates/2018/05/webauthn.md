## The problem

Phishing is the \#1 security problem on the web: 81% of hacking-related account
breaches last year leveraged weak or stolen passwords. The industry's collective
response to this problem has been multi-factor authentication, but
implementations are fragmented and most still don't adequately address phishing.
We have been working with the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/) since
2013 and, more recently, with the W3C to implement a standardized
phishing-resistant protocol that can be used by any Web application.

## What is WebAuthn?

[The Web Authentication API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) gives Web 
applications user-agent-mediated access to authenticators – which are often 
hardware tokens accessed over USB/BLE/NFC or modules built directly into the 
platform – for the purposes of generating and challenging application-scoped 
(eTLD+k) public-key credentials. This enables a variety of use-cases, such as:

* Low friction and phishing-resistant 2FA (to be used in conjunction with 
  a password)
* Passwordless, biometrics-based re-authorization
* Low friction and phishing-resistant 2FA **without** a password (to be used
  for passwordless accounts)

The API is on track to be implemented by most major browsers, and is intended to 
both simplify the UI encountered when having to prove your identity online and 
significantly reduce phishing.

WebAuthn extends the [Credential Management 
API](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/) and adds a new 
credential type called `PublicKeyCredential`. WebAuthn abstracts the 
communication between the browser and an authenticator and allows a user to:

1. Create and register a public key credential for a website
1. Authenticate to a website by proving possession of the corresponding private 
   key

Authenticators are devices that can generate private/public key pairs and gather 
consent. Consent for signing can be granted with a simple tap, a successful 
fingerprint read, or by other methods as long as they comply with FIDO2 
requirements (there's a [certification 
program](https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/) for 
authenticators by the FIDO Alliance). Authenticators can either be built into 
the platform (such as fingerprint scanners on smartphones) or attached through 
USB, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Near-Field Communication (NFC). 

## How it works

### Creating a key pair and registering a user

When a user wants to register a credential to a website (referred to by WebAuthn 
as the "relying party"):

1. The relying party generates a challenge.
1. The relying party asks the browser, through the Credential Manager API, to 
   generate a new credential for the relying party, specifying device 
   capabilities, e.g., whether the device provides its own user authentication 
   (with biometrics, etc).
1. After the authenticator obtains user consent, the authenticator generates a
   key pair and returns the public key and optional signed attestation to the
   website.
1. The web app forwards the public key to the server.
1. The server stores the public key, coupled with the user identity, to remember 
   the credential for future authentications.

```
let credential = await navigator.credentials.create({ publicKey: {
  challenge: Uint8Array(32) [117, 61, 252, 231, 191, 241,…]
  rp: { id: "acme.com", name: "ACME Corporation" },
  user: {
    id: Uint8Array(8) [79, 252, 83, 72, 214, 7, 89, 26]
    name: "jamiedoe",
    displayName: "Jamie Doe"
  },
  pubKeyCredParams: [ {type: "public-key", alg: -7} ]
}});
```

Warning: Attestation provides a way for a relying party to determine the
provenance of an authenticator. **Google strongly recommends that relying parties
not attempt to maintain whitelists of authenticators.**

### Authenticating a user

When a website needs to obtain proof that it is interacting with the correct 
user:

1. The relying party generates a challenge and supplies the browser with a list 
   of credentials that are registered to the user. It can also indicate where to 
   look for the credential, e.g., on a local built-in authenticator, or on an 
   external one over USB, BLE, etc.
1. The browser asks the authenticator to sign the challenge.
1. If the authenticator contains one of the given credentials, the authenticator 
   returns a signed assertion to the web app after receiving user consent.
1. The web app forwards the signed assertion to the server for the relying party 
   to verify.
1. Once verified by the server, the authentication flow is considered 
   successful.

```
let credential = await navigator.credentials.get({ publicKey: {
  challenge: Uint8Array(32) [139, 66, 181, 87, 7, 203,…]
  rpId: "acme.com",
  allowCredentials: [{
    type: "public-key",
    id: Uint8Array(80) [64, 66, 25, 78, 168, 226, 174,…]
  }],
  userVerification: "required",
}});
```

## What's ahead?

Chrome 67 beta ships with support for `navigator.credentials.get({publicKey: 
...})` and `navigator.credentials.create({publicKey:... })` and enables using 
U2F/CTAP 1 authenticators over USB transport on desktop.

Upcoming releases will add support for more transports such as BLE and NFC and 
the newer CTAP 2 wire protocol. We are also working on more advanced flows 
enabled by CTAP 2 and WebAuthn, such as PIN protected authenticators, local 
selection of accounts (instead of typing a username or password), and 
fingerprint enrollment.

Note that [Microsoft Edge also supports the 
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide/device/web-authentication) 
and [Firefox will be supporting WebAuthn as of Firefox 
60](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/using-hardware-token-based-2fa-with-the-webauthn-api/).
