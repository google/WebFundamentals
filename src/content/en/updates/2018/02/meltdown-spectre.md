# Meltdown/Spectre {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/surma.html" %}

## Overview
On January 3rd [Project Zero
revealed](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)
vulnerabilities in modern CPUs that a process can use to read (at worst)
arbitrary memory — including memory that doesn’t belong to that process. These
vulnerabilities have been named [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
and [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf). What is Chrome doing to
help keep the web secure, and what should web developers do for their own sites?

## TL; DR
As a **user browsing the web**, you should make sure you keep your operating
system and your browser updated. In addition, Chrome users can consider enabling
[Site Isolation](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7623121).

If you are a **web developer**, the [Chrome team
advises](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/ssca):

* Where possible, prevent cookies from entering the renderer process' memory by
  using the SameSite and HTTPOnly cookie attributes, and by avoiding reading
  from document.cookie.
* Make sure your MIME types are correct and specify an `X-Content-Type-Options:
  nosniff` header for any URLs with user-specific or sensitive content, to get
  the most out of cross-site document blocking for users who have Site Isolation
  enabled.
* Enable [Site
  Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation) and
  [let the Chrome team know](http://crbug.com/new) if it causes problems for
  your site.

If you are wondering _why_ these steps help, read on!

## The risk
There have been a wide variety of explanations of these vulnerabilities, so I am
not going to add yet another one. If you are interested in how these
vulnerabilities can be exploited, I recommend taking a look at the [blog
post](https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/answering-your-questions-about-meltdown-and-spectre/)
by my colleagues from the Google Cloud team.

Both Meltdown and Spectre potentially allow a process to read memory that it is
not supposed to be able to. Sometimes, multiple documents from different sites
can end up sharing a process in Chrome. This can happen when one has opened the
other using `window.open`, or `<a href="..." target="_blank">`, or iframes. If a
website contains user-specific data, there is a chance that another site could
use these new vulnerabilities to read that user data.


## Mitigations
There are multiple efforts the Chrome and V8 engineering team is deploying to mitigate this threat.

### Site Isolation
The impact of successfully exploiting Spectre can be greatly reduced by
preventing sensitive data from ever sharing a process with attacker-controlled
code. The Chrome team has been working on a feature to achieve this called
“[Site
Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation)”:

> “Websites typically cannot access each other's data inside the browser[...].
> Occasionally, security bugs are found in this code and malicious websites may
> try to bypass these rules to attack other websites. [...] Site Isolation
> offers a second line of defense to make such attacks less likely to succeed.
> **It ensures that pages from different websites are always put into different
> processes, each running in a sandbox that limits what the process is allowed
> to do.**”

Site Isolation has not been enabled by default yet as there are a couple of
[known
issues](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation#TOC-Known-Issues)
and the Chrome team would like as much field testing as possible. If you are a
web developer, you should enable Site Isolation and check whether your site
remains functional. If you’d like to opt-in now, enable
`chrome://flags#enable-site-per-process`. If you find a site that doesn’t work,
please help us by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/new) and mention that you
have Site Isolation enabled.

### Cross-site document blocking
Even when all cross-site pages are put into separate processes, pages can still
legitimately request some cross-site subresources, such as images and
JavaScript. To help prevent sensitive information from leaking this information,
Site Isolation includes a “[cross-site document
blocking](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/blocking-cross-site-documents)”
feature that limits which network responses are delivered to the renderer
process.

A website can request two types of data from a server: “documents” and
“resources”. Here, documents are HTML, XML, JSON and TXT files. A website is
able to receive documents from its own domain or from other domains with
permissive CORS headers. Resources include things like images, JavaScript, CSS
and fonts. Resources can be included from any site.

The cross-site document blocking policy prevents a process from receiving
“documents” from other origins if:

1. They have an HTML, XML, JSON, or text/plain MIME type, and
1. They have either a "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" HTTP response header, or
   a quick content analysis (“[sniffing](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/)”)
   confirms that the type is correct
1. CORS doesn’t explicitly allow access to the document

Documents that are blocked by this policy are presented to the process as empty,
although the request still happens in the background.

For example: Imagine an attacker creating an `<img>` tag that includes a JSON
file with sensitive data, like `<img src="https://yourbank.com/balance.json">`.
Without Site Isolation, the contents of the JSON file would make it to the
renderer process’s memory, at which point the renderer notices that it is not a
valid image format and doesn’t render an image. With Spectre, however, there is
now a way to potentially read that chunk of memory. Cross-site document blocking
would prevent the contents of this file from ever entering the memory of the
process the renderer is running in because the MIME type is blocked by
cross-site document blocking.

According to user metrics, there are a lot of JavaScript and CSS files that are
delivered with `text/html` or `text/plain` MIME types. To avoid blocking
resources that are accidentally marked as documents, Chrome attempts to sniff
the response to ensure the MIME type is correct. This sniffing is imperfect, so
if you are sure that you are setting the correct `Content-Type` headers on your
website, the Chrome team recommends adding the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
header to all your responses.

If you want to try cross-site document blocking, opt-in to Site Isolation as
described above.

### `SameSite` cookies
Let’s go back to the example above: `<img
src="https://yourbank.com/balance.json">`. This only works if yourbank.com has
stored a cookie that automatically logs the user in. Cookies typically get sent
for all requests to the website that sets the cookie — even if the request is
made by a third party using an `<img>` tag. SameSite cookies are a new attribute
that specify that a cookie should only be attached to a request that originates
from the same site, hence the name. Sadly, at the time of writing, [only Chrome
and Firefox 58+ support this
attribute](https://caniuse.com/#feat=same-site-cookie-attribute).

### `HTTPOnly` and `document.cookie`
If your site's cookies are only used server-side, not by client JavaScript,
there are ways you can stop the cookie's data from entering the renderer
process. You can set the [`HTTPOnly`](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly)
cookie attribute, which explicitly prevents the cookie from being accessed
through client side script on supported browsers, such as Chrome. If setting
`HTTPOnly` isn't possible, you can help limit the exposure of loading cookie
data to the rendered process by not reading `document.cookie` unless absolutely
necessary.

### Open External Links Using `rel="noopener"`
When you link to another page using `target="_blank"`, the opened page [has
access to your `window` object](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/),
can navigate your page to a different URL, and without Site Isolation will be in
the same process as your page. To better protect your page, links to external
pages that open in a new window should always [specify
`rel="noopener"`](/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener).

### High-resolution timers
To exploit Meltdown or Spectre, an attacker needs to measure how long it takes
to read a certain value from memory. For this, a reliable and accurate timer is
needed.

One API the web platform offers is
[`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)
which is accurate to 5 microseconds. As a mitigation, all major browsers have
decreased the resolution of `performance.now()` to make it harder to mount the
attacks.

Another way to get a high-resolution timer is to use a
[SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer).
The buffer is used by a dedicated worker to increment a counter. The main thread
reads this counter and uses that as a timer. For the time being browsers have
decided to disable SharedArrayBuffer until other mitigations are in place.

### V8
To exploit Spectre, a specifically crafted sequence of CPU instructions is
needed. The V8 team has implemented mitigations for known attack proofs of
concept, and is working on changes in TurboFan, their optimizing compiler, that
make its generated code safe even when these attacks are triggered. However,
these code generation changes may come at a performance penalty.

## Keeping the web safe
There has been a lot of uncertainty around the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown
and their implications. I hope this article shed some light on what the Chrome
and V8 teams are doing to keep the web platform safe, and how web developers can
help by using existing security features. If you have any questions, feel free
