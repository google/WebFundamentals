## What happens in navigation

This is part 2 of a 4 part blog series looking at the inner workings of Chrome. 
In [the previous post](/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part1), we looked at how different 
processes and threads handle different parts of a browser. In this post, we dig deeper into how 
each process and thread communicate in order to display a website.

Let’s look at a simple use case of web browsing: you type a URL into a browser, then the browser 
fetches data from the internet and displays a page. In this post, we’ll focus on the part where a 
user requests a site and the browser prepares to render a page - also known as a navigation.


## It starts with a browser process

</figure>

As we covered in 
[part 1: CPU, GPU, Memory, and multi-process architecture](/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part1), 
everything outside of a tab is handled by the browser process. 
The browser process has threads like the UI thread which draws buttons and input fields of the 
browser, the network thread which deals with network stack to receive data from the internet, 
the storage thread that controls access to the files and more. When you type a URL into the address 
bar, your input is handled by browser process’s UI thread.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## A simple navigation 

### Step 1: Handling input

When a user starts to type into the address bar, the first thing UI thread asks is "Is this a 
search query or URL?". In Chrome, the address bar is also a search input field, so the UI thread 
needs to parse and decide whether to send you to a search engine, or to the site you requested.  

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/input.png" alt="Handling user input">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 1: UI Thread asking if the input is a search query or a URL
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 2: Start navigation

When a user hits enter, the UI thread initiates a network call to get site content. Loading spinner 
is displayed on the corner of a tab, and the network thread goes through appropriate protocols like 
DNS lookup and establishing TLS Connection for the request.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/navstart.png" alt="Navigation start">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 2: the UI thread talking to the network thread to navigate to mysite.com
  </figcaption>
</figure>

At this point, the network thread may receive a server redirect header like HTTP 301. In that case, 
the network thread communicates with UI thread that the server is requesting redirect. Then, 
another URL request will be initiated. 

### Step 3: Read response

<figure class="attempt-right">
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/response.png" alt="HTTP response">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 3: response header which contains Content-Type and payload which is the actual data 
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Once the response body (payload) starts to come in, the network thread looks at the first few bytes 
of the stream if necessary. The response's Content-Type header should say what type of data it is, 
but since it may be missing or wrong, 
[MIME Type sniffing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) 
is done here. This is a "tricky business" as commented in [the source code](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/base/mime_sniffer.cc?sq=package:chromium&dr=CS&l=5). 
You can read the comment to see how different browsers treat content-type/payload pairs.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

If the response is an HTML file, then the next step would be to pass the data to the renderer 
process, but if it is a zip file or some other file then that means it is a download request so 
they need to pass the data to download manager.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/sniff.png" alt="MIME type sniffing">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 4: Network thread asking if response data is HTML from a safe site 
  </figcaption>
</figure>

This is also where the [SafeBrowsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/) check happens. 
If the domain and the response data seems to match a known malicious site, then the network thread 
alerts to display a warning page. Additionally, 
[**C**ross **O**rigin **R**ead **B**locking (**CORB**)](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/corb-for-developers) 
check happens in order to make sure sensitive cross-site 
data does not make it to the renderer process.

### Step 3: Find a renderer process

Once all of the checks are done and Network thread is confident that browser should navigate to the 
requested site, the Network thread tells UI thread that the data is ready. UI thread then finds a 
renderer process to carry on rendering of the web page. 

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/findrenderer.png" alt="Find renderer process">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 5: Network thread telling UI thread to find Renderer Process 
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Since the network request could take several hundred milliseconds to get a response back, an 
optimization to speed up this process is applied. When the UI thread is sending a URL request to 
the network thread at step 2, it already knows which site they are navigating to. The UI thread 
tries to proactively find or start a renderer process in parallel to the network request. This way, 
if all goes as expected, a renderer process is already in standby position when the network thread 
received data. This standby process might not get used if the navigation redirects cross-site, in 
which case a different process might be needed.

### Step 4: Commit navigation

Now that the data and the renderer process is ready, an IPC is sent from the browser process to the 
renderer process to commit the navigation. It also passes on the data stream so the renderer 
process can keep receiving HTML data. Once the browser process hears confirmation that the commit 
has happened in the renderer process, the navigation is complete and the document loading phase 
begins.

At this point, address bar is updated and the security indicator and site settings UI reflects the 
site information of the new page. The session history for the tab will be updated so back/forward 
buttons will step through the site that was just navigated to. To facilitate tab/session restore 
when you close a tab or window, the session history is stored on disk.

<figure>

  <figcaption>
    Figure 6: IPC between the browser and the renderer processes, requesting to render the page 
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Extra Step: Initial load complete

Once the navigation is committed, the renderer process carries on loading resources and renders the 
page. We will go over the details of what happens at this stage in the next post. Once the renderer 
process "finishes" rendering, it sends an IPC back to the browser process (this is after all the 
`onload` events have fired on all frames in the page and have finished executing). At this point, 
the UI thread stops the loading spinner on the tab. 

I say "finishes", because client side JavaScript could still load 
additional resources and render new views after this point.

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Navigating to a different site

The simple navigation was complete! But what happens if a user puts different URL to address bar 
again? Well, the browser process goes through the same steps to navigate to the different site. 
But before it can do that, it needs to check with the currently rendered site if they care about 
[`beforeunload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/beforeunload) event. 

`beforeunload` can create "Leave this site?" alert when you try to navigate away or close the tab. 
Everything inside of a tab including your JavaScript code is handled by the renderer process, so 
the browser process has to check with current renderer process when new navigation request comes in.

Caution: Do not add unconditional `beforeunload` handlers. It creates more latency because the 
handler needs to be executed before the navigation can even be started. This event handler should 
be added only when needed, for example if users need to be warned that they might lose data they've 
entered on the page.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/beforeunload.png" 
    alt="beforeunload event handler">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 8: IPC from the browser process to a renderer process telling it that it's about to 
    navigate to a different site
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If the navigation was initiated from the renderer process (like user clicked on a link or 
client-side JavaScript has run `window.location = "https://newsite.com"`) the renderer process 
first checks `beforeunload` handlers. Then, it goes through the same process as browser process 
initiated navigation. The only difference is that navigation request is kicked off from the 
renderer process to the browser process.

When the new navigation is made to a different site than currently rendered one, a separate render 
process is called in to handle the new navigation while current render process is kept around to 
handle events like `unload`. For more, see [an overview of page lifecycle states](/web/updates/2018/07/page-lifecycle-api#overview_of_page_lifecycle_states_and_events) 
and how you can hook into events with 
[the Page Lifecycle API](/web/updates/2018/07/page-lifecycle-api).

    and telling old renderer process to unload
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## In case of Service Worker

One recent change to this navigation process is the introduction of 
[service worker](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/). Service worker is a way to write 
network proxy in your application code; allowing web developers to have more control over what to 
cache locally and when to get new data from the network. If service worker is set to load the page 
from the cache, there is no need to request the data from the network.

The important part to remember is that service worker is JavaScript code that runs in a renderer 
process. But when the navigation request comes in, how does a browser process know the site has a 
service worker?

<figure class="attempt-right">
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/scope_lookup.png" 
    alt="Service worker scope lookup">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 10: the network thread in the browser process looking up service worker scope
  </figcaption>
</figure>

When a service worker is registered, the scope of the service worker is kept as a reference 
(you can read more about scope in this 
[The Service Worker Lifecycle](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle) article). 
When a navigation happens, network thread checks the domain against registered service worker 
scopes, if a service worker is registered for that URL, the UI thread finds a renderer process in 
order to execute the service worker code. The service worker may load data from cache, eliminating 
the need to request data from the network, or it may request new resources from the network.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part2/serviceworker.png" 
    alt="serviceworker navigation">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 11: the UI thread in a browser process starting up a renderer process to handle service 
    workers; a worker thread in a renderer process then requests data from the network
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Navigation Preload

You can see this round trip between the browser process and renderer process could result in delays 
if service worker eventually decides to request data from the network. 
[Navigation Preload](/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload) is a mechanism to speed up this 
process by loading resources in parallel to service worker startup. 
It marks these requests with a header, allowing servers to decide to send different content for 
these requests; for example, just updated data instead of a full document.

    worker while kicking off network request in parallel

## Wrap-up

In this post, we looked at what happens during a navigation and how your web application code such 
as response headers and client-side JavaScript interact with the browser. Knowing the steps browser 
goes through to get data from the network makes it easier to understand why APIs like navigation 
preload were developed. In the next post, we’ll dive into how the browser evaluates our 
HTML/CSS/JavaScript to render pages.
