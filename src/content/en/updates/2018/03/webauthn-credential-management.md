### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }
[WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) helps increase security by bringing
public-key credential based authentication to the Web, and is soon to be
supported in Chrome, Firefox and Edge ([with the updated
spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/dev-guide/device/web-authentication#differences-between-microsoft-edge-and-the-spec)).
It adds a new kind of `Credential` object, which, however, may break websites
that use [the Credential Management
API](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/) without feature-detecting
the specific credential types they're using.

### If you are currently doing this for feature detection:

    if (navigator.credentials && navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess) {
      // use CM API
    }

### Do these instead:

    if (window.PasswordCredential || window.FederatedCredential) {
      // Call navigator.credentials.get() to retrieve stored
      // PasswordCredentials or FederatedCredentials.
    }

    if (window.PasswordCredential) {
      // Get/Store PasswordCredential
    }

    if (window.FederatedCredential) {
      // Get/Store FederatedCredential
    }

    if (navigator.credentials && navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess) {
      // Call navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess()
    }

See [changes](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/credential-management-sample/pull/15/files
) made to the sample code as an example.

Note: If you are using Google identity as a primary way for your users to
sign-in, consider using the [one tap sign-up and automatic
sign-in](/identity/one-tap/web/) JavaScript library
built on the Credential Management API. It combines Google sign-in and
password-based sign-in into one API call, and adds support for one-tap account
creation.

## What is the Credential Management API
[The Credential Management API](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/)
(CM API) gives websites programmatic access to the user agentâ€™s credential store
for storing/retrieving user credentials for the calling origin.

Basic APIs are:

* `navigator.credentials.get()`
* `navigator.credentials.store()`
* `navigator.credentials.create()`
* `navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess()`

The original CM API specification defines 2 credential types:

* `PasswordCredential`
* `FederatedCredential`

The `PasswordCredential` is a credential that contains user's id and password.  
The `FederatedCredential` is a credential that contains user's id and a string
that represents an identity provider.

With these 2 credentials, websites can:

* Let the user sign-in with a previously saved password-based or federated
  credential as soon as they land (auto sign-in),
* Store the password-based or federated credential the user has signed in with,
* Keep the user's sign-in credentials up-to-date (e.g. after a password change)

## What is WebAuthn
[WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) (Web Authentication) adds public-key
credentials to the CM API. For example, it gives websites a standardized way to
implement second-factor authentication using [FIDO
2.0](https://fidoalliance.org/) compliant authenticator devices.

On a technical level, WebAuthn extends the CM API with the `PublicKeyCredential`
interface.

## What is the problem?
Previously we have been guiding developers to feature detect the CM API with
following code:

    if (navigator.credentials && navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess) {
      // Use CM API
    }

But as you can see from the descriptions above, the `navigator.credentials` is
now expanded to support public-key credentials in addition to password
credentials and federated credentials.

The problem is that user agents don't necessarily support all kinds of
credentials. If you continue feature detect using `navigator.credentials`, your
website may break when you are using a certain credential type not supported by
the browser.

</td></tr></tbody></table>

## The solution
You can avoid this by modifying feature detection code as follows to explicitly
test for the credential type that you intend to use.

    if (window.PasswordCredential || window.FederatedCredential) {
      // Call navigator.credentials.get() to retrieve stored
      // PasswordCredentials or FederatedCredentials.
    }

    if (window.PasswordCredential) {
      // Get/Store PasswordCredential
    }

    if (window.FederatedCredential) {
      // Get/Store FederatedCredential
    }

    if (navigator.credentials && navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess) {
      // Call navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess()
    }

See [actual
changes](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/credential-management-sample/pull/15/files
) made to the sample code as an example.

For a reference, here's how to detect `PublicKeyCredential` added in WebAuthn:

    if (window.PublicKeyCredential) {
      // use CM API with PublicKeyCredential added in the WebAuthn spec
    }

## Timeline

Earliest available implementation of WebAuthn is Firefox and is [planned to be stable around early May 2018](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar).
