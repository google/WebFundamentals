## What the _smoosh_ happened?! {: #what }

A [proposal](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-flatMap/) for a JavaScript
language feature called `Array.prototype.flatten` turns out to be
Web-incompatible. Shipping the feature in Firefox Nightly caused [at least
one popular website](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1443630)
to break. Given that the problematic code is part of the widespread MooTools
library, it’s likely that many more websites are affected. (Although MooTools
is not commonly used for new websites in 2018, it used to be very popular and
is still present on many production websites.)

The proposal author jokingly suggested renaming `flatten` to `smoosh` to
avoid the compatibility issue. The joke was not clear to everyone, some
people started to incorrectly believe that the new name had already been
decided, and things escalated quickly.

## What does `Array.prototype.flatten` do? {: #flatten }

`Array.prototype.flat`, originally proposed as `Array.prototype.flatten`,
flattens arrays recursively up to the specified `depth`, which defaults
to `1`.

```js
// Flatten one level:
const array = [1, [2, [3]]];
array.flat();
// → [1, 2, [3]]

// Flatten recursively until the array contains no more nested arrays:
array.flat(Infinity);
// → [1, 2, 3]
```

Note: Since the publication of this article, `flatten` has been renamed to
`flat` to resolve #SmooshGate. The above example has been updated accordingly,
but keep in mind that the original name was `flatten`.

The same proposal includes `Array.prototype.flatMap`, which is like
`Array.prototype.map` except it flattens the result into a new array.

```js
[2, 3, 4].flatMap((x) => [x, x * 2]);
// → [2, 4, 3, 6, 4, 8]
```

## What is MooTools doing that causes this problem? {: #mootools }

MooTools defines their own non-standard version of `Array.prototype.flatten`:

```js
Array.prototype.flatten = /* non-standard implementation */;
```

MooTools’ `flatten` implementation differs from the proposed standard.
However, this is not the problem! When browsers ship
`Array.prototype.flatten` natively, MooTools overrides the native
implementation. This ensures that code relying on the MooTools behavior
works as intended regardless of whether native `flatten` is available.
So far, so good!

Unfortunately, something else then happens. MooTools copies over all its
custom array methods to `Elements.prototype` (where `Elements` is a
MooTools-specific API):

```js
for (var key in Array.prototype) {
  Elements.prototype[key] = Array.prototype[key];
}
```

`for`-`in` iterates over “enumerable” properties, which doesn’t include
native methods like `Array.prototype.sort`, but it does include
regularly-assigned properties like `Array.prototype.foo = whatever`.  But —
and here’s the kicker — if you overwrite a non-enumerable property, e.g.
`Array.prototype.sort = whatever`, it remains non-enumerable.

Currently, `Array.prototype.flatten = mooToolsFlattenImplementation` creates
an enumerable `flatten` property, so it’s later copied to `Elements`. But if
browsers ship a native version of `flatten`, it becomes non-enumerable, and
_isn’t_ copied to `Elements`. **Any code relying on MooTools’
`Elements.prototype.flatten` is now broken.**

Although it seems like changing the native `Array.prototype.flatten` to be
enumerable would fix the problem, it would likely cause even more
compatibility issues. Every website relying on `for`-`in` to iterate over
an array (which is a bad practice, but it happens) would then suddenly get
an additional loop iteration for the `flatten` property.

The bigger underlying problem here is modifying built-in objects. Extending
native prototypes is generally accepted as a bad practice nowadays, as it
doesn’t compose nicely with other libraries and third-party code. Don’t modify
objects you don’t own!

## Why don’t we just keep the existing name and break the Web? {: #break-the-web }

In 1996, before CSS became widespread, and long before “HTML5” became a
thing, [the Space Jam
website](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm) went
live. Today, the website still works the same way it did 22 years ago.

How did that happen? Did someone maintain that website for all these years,
updating it every time browser vendors shipped a new feature?

As it turns out, “don’t break the Web” is the number one [design
principle](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#support-existing-content)
for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other standard that’s widely used on the
Web. If shipping a new browser feature causes existing websites to stop
working, that’s bad for *everyone*:

- visitors of the affected websites suddenly get a broken user experience;
- the website owners went from having a perfectly-working website to a
  non-functional one without them changing anything;
- browser vendors shipping the new feature lose market share, due to users
  switching browsers after noticing “it works in browser X”;
- once the compatibility issue is known, other browser vendors refuse to ship
  it. The feature specification does not match reality ([“nothing but a work
  of fiction”](https://www.webstandards.org/2009/05/13/interview-with-ian-hickson-editor-of-the-html-5-specification/#about-browsers)),
  which is bad for the standardization process.

Sure, in retrospect MooTools did the wrong thing — but breaking the web
doesn’t punish them, it punishes users. These users do not know what a moo
tool is. Alternatively, we can find another solution, and users can continue
to use the web. The choice is easy to make.

## Does that mean bad APIs can never be removed from the Web Platform? {: #removing-apis }

It depends. In rare cases, [bad features can be removed from
the Web](https://whatwg.org/faq#removing-bad-ideas). Even just figuring
out whether it’s _possible_ to remove a feature is a very tricky effort,
requiring extensive telemetry to quantify how many web pages would have their
behavior changed. But when the feature is sufficiently insecure, is harmful to
users, or is used very rarely, this can be done.

`<applet>`, `<keygen>`, and
[`showModalDialog()`](https://dev.opera.com/blog/showmodaldialog/) are all
examples of bad APIs that were successfully removed from the Web Platform.

## Why don’t we just fix MooTools? {: #fix-mootools }

Patching MooTools so that it no longer extends built-in objects is a good
idea. However, it doesn’t solve the problem at hand. Even if MooTools were
to release a patched version, all existing websites using it would have to
update for the compatibility problem to go away.

## Can’t people just update their copy of MooTools? {: #update-mootools }

In a perfect world, MooTools would release a patch, and every single website
using MooTools would magically be updated the next day. Problem solved,
right?!

Unfortunately, this is unrealistic. Even if someone were to somehow identify
the full set of affected websites, manage to find contact information for
each and every one of them, successfully reach out to all the website owners,
and convince them all to perform the update (which might mean refactoring
their entire code base), the entire process would take years, at best.

Keep in mind that many of these websites are old and likely unmaintained.
Even if the maintainer is still around, it’s possible they’re not a
highly-skilled web developer like yourself. We can’t expect everyone to go
and change their 8-year-old website because of a web compatibility issue.

## How does the TC39 process work? {: #tc39 }

TC39 is the committee in charge of evolving the JavaScript language through
the ECMAScript standard.

_#SmooshGate_ caused some to believe that “TC39 wants to rename `flatten` to
`smoosh`”, but it was an in-joke that wasn’t well-communicated externally.
Major decisions like renaming a proposal are not taken lightly, are not taken
by a single person, and are definitely not taken overnight based on a single
GitHub comment.

TC39 operates on [a clear staging
process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) for feature proposals.
ECMAScript proposals and any major changes to them (including method
renaming) are discussed during TC39 meetings, and need to be approved by the
entire committee before they become official. In the case of
`Array.prototype.flatten`, the proposal has already gone through several
stages of agreement, all the way up to Stage 3, indicating the feature is
ready to be implemented in Web browsers. It’s common for additional spec
issues to come up during implementation. In this case, the most important
feedback came _after_ trying to ship it: the feature, in its current state,
breaks the Web. Hard-to-predict issues like these are part of the reason why
the TC39 process doesn’t just end once browsers ship a feature.

TC39 operates on consensus, meaning the committee has to agree on any new
changes. Even if `smoosh` had been a serious suggestion, it seems likely that
a committee member would object to it in favor of a more common name like
`compact` or `chain`.

The renaming from `flatten` to `smoosh` (even if it hadn’t been a joke) has
never been discussed at a TC39 meeting. As such, the official TC39 stance on
this topic is currently unknown. No single individual can speak on behalf of
all of TC39 until consensus is reached at the next meeting.

TC39 meetings are generally attended by people with highly diverse
backgrounds: some have years of programming language design experience,
others work on a browser or JavaScript engine, and an increasing number of
attendants are there to represent the JavaScript developer community.

## How was SmooshGate resolved, eventually? {: #resolution }

During [the May 2018 TC39
meeting](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2018/05.md), #SmooshGate
was officially resolved by renaming `flatten` to `flat`.

`Array.prototype.flat` and `Array.prototype.flatMap` shipped in V8 v6.9 and
Chrome 69.
