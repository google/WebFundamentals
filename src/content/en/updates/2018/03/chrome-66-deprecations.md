## ImageCapture.setOptions() removed

Current thinking on setting device options is to use the
[constrainable pattern](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/archives/20141205/getusermedia.html#constrainable-interface)
. Consequently this property was removed from the
[ImageCapture specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/image-capture/#imagecaptureapi)
. Since this method appears to have little to no use on production websites, it
is being removed. A replacement method is not available at this time.

## Service worker: disallow CORS responses for same-origin requests

Previous versions of the service worker specification allowed a service worker
to return a CORS response to a same-origin request. The thinking was that the
service worker could read from a CORS response to create a completely synthetic
response. In spite of this, the original request URL was maintained in the
response. So `outerResponse.url` exactly equaled `url` and `innerResponse.url`
exactly equaled `crossOriginURL`.

A recent [change to the Fetch specification](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/146)
requires that `Response.url` be exposed if it is present. A consequence of this
is scenarios in which `self.location.href` returns a different origin than
`self.origin`. To avoid this, service workers are no longer allowed to return
CORS responses for same origin requests.

For a longer discussion on this change, see the
[issue filed against the Fetch specification](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/629)
in November 2017.

## WebAudio: dezippering removed

Web audio originally shipped with dezippering support.  When an AudioParam value
was set directly with the value setter, the value was not updated immediately.
Instead, an exponential smoother was applied with a time constant of about 10 ms
so that the change was done smoothly, limiting glitches.  It was never specified
which parameters had smoothing and what the time constant was.  It wasnâ€™t even
obvious if the actual time constant was the appropriate value.

After [much discussion](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWebAudio%2Fweb-audio-api%2Fissues%2F76&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGdcDCW3wiMGghiBNln2AT5mjEqpg)
, the working group removed dezippering from the spec. Now, the value is changed
immediately when set. In place of dezippering, it is recommended that developers
use the existing `AudioParam.setTargetAtTime()` method to do the dezippering,
giving you full control on when to apply it, how fast to change, and on which
parameters should be smoothed.

Removing this reduces developer confusion which audio parameters support dezippering.

## CSS position values with three parts deprecated

Recently specifications have required that new properties accepting position
values not support values with three parts. It's believed this approach makes
processing shorthand syntax easier. The current version of the
[CSS Values and Units Module](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4) applies
this requirement to all CSS position values. As of Chrome 66, three-part
position values are deprecated. Removal is expected in Chrome 68, around July 2018.

## Methods document.createTouch(), document.createTouchList() are deprecated

The `TouchEvent()` constructor has been
[supported in Chrome](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/TouchEvent#Browser_compatibility)
since version 48. To comply with the specification, `document.createTouch()` and
`document.createTouchList()` are now deprecated.
