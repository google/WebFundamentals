# What's New In DevTools (Chrome 64) {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/kaycebasques.html" %}

Note: The video version of these release notes will be published around
late-January 2018.

Welcome back! New features coming to DevTools in Chrome 64 include:

* [Performance Monitor](#perf-monitor). View a page's performance in real-time.
* [Console Sidebar](#console-sidebar). Reduce Console noise and focus on the messages that are
  important to you.
* [Group similar Console messages](#group-similar). The Console now groups similar messages
  together by default.

Note: Check what version of Chrome you're running at `chrome://version`. If you're running
an earlier version, these features won't exist. If you're running a later version, these features
may have changed. Chrome auto-updates to a new major version about every 6 weeks.

## Performance Monitor {: #perf-monitor }

Use the Performance Monitor to get a real-time view of various aspects of a page's performance,
including:

* CPU usage.
* JavaScript heap size.
* The total number of DOM nodes, JavaScript event listeners, documents, and frames on the page.
* Layouts and style recalculations per second.

To use the Performance Monitor:

1. Open the [Command Menu](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/ui#command-menu).
1. Start typing `Performance` then select `Show Performance Monitor`.

     </figure>

1. Click a metric to show or hide it. In Figure 1 the **CPU Usage**, **JS heap size**, and
   **JS event listeners** charts are shown.

## Console Sidebar {: #console-sidebar }

On large sites, the Console can quickly get flooded with irrelevant messages. Use the new
**Console Sidebar** to reduce the noise and focus on the messages that are important to you.

    <b>Figure 2</b>. Using the Console Sidebar to show error messages only
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The Console Sidebar is hidden by default. Click **Show Console Sidebar** ![Show Console
Sidebar](/web/updates/images/2017/11/show-console-sidebar.png){:.cdt-inl} to show it.

## Group similar Console messages {: #group-similar }

The Console now groups similar messages together by default. For example, in Figure 3
there are 27 instances of the message `[Violation] Avoid using document.write()`.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/11/group-similar.png"
       alt="An example of the Console grouping similar messages together"
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 3</b>. An example of the Console grouping similar messages together
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Click on a group to expand it and see each instance of the message.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/11/group-expanded.png"
       alt="An example of an expanded group of Console messages"
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 4</b>. An example of an expanded group of Console messages

Uncheck the **Group Similar** checkbox to disable this feature.
