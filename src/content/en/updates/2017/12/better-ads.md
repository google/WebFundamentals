# An update on Better Ads {: .page-title }

Yesterday, the Coalition for Better Ads [announced the "Better Ads Experience
Program."](https://www.betterads.org/coalition-for-better-ads-to-introduce-better-ads-experience-program/)
This Program provides guidelines for companies like Google on how they can use
the [Better Ads Standards](http://betterads.org/standards) to help improve
users' experience with ads on the web. 

In June, [we
announced](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/improving-advertising-on-web.html)
Chrome's plans to support the Better Ads Standards in early 2018. Violations of
the Standards are reported to sites via the [Ad Experience
Report](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ad-experience-unverified), and
site owners can submit their site for re-review once the violations have been
fixed. Starting on February 15, in line with the Coalition's guidelines, Chrome
will remove all ads from sites that have a "failing" status in the Ad Experience
Report for more than 30 days. All of this information can be found in the [Ad
Experience Report Help
Center](https://support.google.com/webtools/topic/7073612?hl=en&ref_topic=7566613),
and our [product
forums](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/ad-experience-report) are
available to help address any questions or feedback.

We look forward to continuing to work with industry bodies to improve the user
experience for everyone.
