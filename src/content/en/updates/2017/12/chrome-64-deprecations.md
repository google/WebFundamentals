In nearly every version of Chrome, we see a significant number of updates and
improvements to the product, its performance, and also capabilities of the Web
Platform. This article describes some of the deprecations and removals in Chrome
64, which is in beta as of December 14.

## Remove support for multiple shadow roots

Shadow DOM version 0 allowed multiple shadow roots. At a [standards meeting in
April 2015](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webapps/WebComponentsApril2015Meeting) it
was decided that this feature should not be part of version 1. Support was
deprecated shortly thereafter in Chrome 45. In Chrome 64 support is now removed.

## Remove getMatchedCSSRules()

The `getMatchedCSSRules()` method is a non-standard, WebKit-only API that
retrieves a list of style rules applied to a particular element. This has been
[deprecated since 2014](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/blink-dev/fd-QLCiLESQ/discussion).
It's now being removed because it's not on a standards track.

Since there is currently no standards-based alternative, developers would need
to create their own. There is at least [one example on
StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2952667/find-all-css-rules-that-apply-to-an-element).
