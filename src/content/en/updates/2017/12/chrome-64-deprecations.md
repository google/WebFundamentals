# Deprecations and removals in Chrome 64 {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/josephmedley.html" %}

In nearly every version of Chrome, we see a significant number of updates and
improvements to the product, its performance, and also capabilities of the Web
Platform. This article describes some of the deprecations and removals in Chrome
64, which is in beta as of December 14. Visit the
[deprecations page](/web/updates/tags/deprecations) for more deprecations and
removals from this and previous versions of Chrome. This list is subject to
change at any time.

## Deprecate chrome.loadTimes()

The `chrome.loadTimes()` method is a non-standard API that enables collecting
loading-related metrics in real-world operations. A [Resource Timing Level
1](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing-1/) API has existed for several years
while the current version of it is a W3C Candidate Recommendation. Chrome itself
has been working to implement these for some time. For these reasons,
the `chrome.loadTimes()` method is deprecated in Chrome 64. Removal is
anticipated some time in late 2018.

Developers needing an alternative should look at several spec-based APIs. Most
of the data returned by `chrome.loadTimes()` can be retrieved with the
[Navigation Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API).
`chrome.loadTimes()` also returns a `firstPaintTime` property. The spec-based
alternative is the
[PerformancePaintTiming interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformancePaintTiming).

## Remove support for multiple shadow roots

Shadow DOM version 0 allowed multiple shadow roots. At a [standards meeting in
April 2015](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webapps/WebComponentsApril2015Meeting) it
was decided that this feature should not be part of version 1. Support was
deprecated shortly thereafter in Chrome 45. In Chrome 64 support is now removed.

## Remove getMatchedCSSRules()

The `getMatchedCSSRules()` method is a non-standard, WebKit-only API that
retrieves a list of style rules applied to a particular element. This has been
[deprecated since 2014](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/blink-dev/fd-QLCiLESQ/discussion).
It's now being removed because it's not on a standards track.

Since there is currently no standards-based alternative, developers would need
to create their own. There is at least [one example on
StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2952667/find-all-css-rules-
that-apply-to-an-element).
