Chrome 64 comes with a highly anticipated new feature in Web Audio API -
[AudioWorklet](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioWorklet). This
article introduces its concept and usage for those who are eager to create a
custom audio processor with JavaScript code. Please take a look at the [live
demos](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/) on
GitHub or [the instruction](#experimental) on how to use this feature.

### Background: ScriptProcessorNode

Audio processing in Web Audio API runs in a separate thread from the main
UI thread, so it runs smoothly. To enable custom audio processing in
JavaScript, the Web Audio API proposed a ScriptProcessorNode which used
event handlers to invoke user script in the main UI thread.

There are two problems in this design: the event handling is asynchronous
by design, and the code execution happens on the main thread. The former
induces the latency, and the latter pressures the main thread that is
commonly crowded with various UI and DOM-related tasks causing either UI
to "jank" or audio to "glitch". Because of this fundamental design flaw,
<code>ScriptProcessorNode</code> is deprecated from the specification and
replaced with AudioWorklet.


## Concepts

Audio Worklet nicely keeps the user-supplied JavaScript code all within the
audio processing thread — that is, it doesn’t have to jump over to the main
thread to process audio. This means the user-supplied script code gets to run
on the audio rendering thread (AudioWorkletGlobalScope) along with other
built-in AudioNodes, which ensures zero additional latency and synchronous
rendering.

### Registration and Instantiation

Using Audio Worklet consists of two parts: AudioWorkletProcessor and
AudioWorkletNode. This is more involved than using ScriptProcessorNode,
but it is needed to give developers the low-level capability for custom audio
processing. AudioWorkletProcessor represents the actual audio processor
written in JavaScript code, and it lives in the AudioWorkletGlobalScope.
AudioWorkletNode is the counterpart of AudioWorkletProcessor and takes
care of the connection to and from other AudioNodes in the main thread. It
is exposed in the main global scope and functions like a regular AudioNode.

Here's a pair of code snippets that demonstrate the registration and the
instantiation.

```js
// The code in the main global scope.
class MyWorkletNode extends AudioWorkletNode {
  constructor(context) {
    super(context, 'my-worklet-processor');
  }
}

let context = new AudioContext();

context.audioWorklet.addModule('processors.js').then(() => {
  let node = new MyWorkletNode(context);
});
```

Creating an AudioWorkletNode requires at least two things: an AudioContext
object and the processor name as a string. A processor definition can be
loaded and registered by the new Audio Worklet object's `addModule()` call.
Worklet APIs including Audio Worklet are only available in a
[secure context](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/), thus a
page using them must be served over HTTPS, although `http://localhost` is
considered a secure for local testing.

It is also worth noting that you can subclass AudioWorkletNode to define
a custom node backed by the processor running on the worklet.

```js
// This is "processor.js" file, evaluated in AudioWorkletGlobalScope upon
// audioWorklet.addModule() call in the main global scope.
class MyWorkletProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    // audio processing code here.
  }
}

registerProcessor('my-worklet-processor', MyWorkletProcessor);
```

The `registerProcessor()` method in the AudioWorkletGlobalScope takes a
string for the name of processor to be registered and the class definition.
After the completion of script code evaluation in the global scope, the
promise from `AudioWorklet.addModule()` will be resolved notifying users
that the class definition is ready to be used in the main global scope.

### Custom AudioParam
One of the useful things about AudioNodes is schedulable parameter
automation with AudioParams. AudioWorkletNodes can use these to get
exposed parameters that can be controlled at the audio rate automatically.

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/12/webaudio-2.svg">

User-defined AudioParams can be declared in an AudioWorkletProcessor
class definition by setting up a set of AudioParamDescriptors. The
underlying WebAudio engine will pick up this information upon the
construction of an AudioWorkletNode, and will then create and link
AudioParam objects to the node accordingly.

```js
/* A separate script file, like "my-worklet-processor.js" */
class MyWorkletProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {

  // Static getter to define AudioParam objects in this custom processor.
  static get parameterDescriptors() {
    return [{
      name: 'myParam',
      defaultValue: 0.707
    }];
  }

  constructor() { super(); }

  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    // |myParamValues| is a Float32Array of either 1 or 128 audio samples
    // calculated by WebAudio engine from regular AudioParam operations.
    // (automation methods, setter) Without any AudioParam change, this array
    // would be a single value of 0.707.
    const myParamValues = parameters.myParam;

    if (myParamValues.length === 1) {
      // |myParam| has been a constant value for the current render quantum,
      // which can be accessed by |myParamValues[0]|.
    } else {
      // |myParam| has been changed and |myParamValues| has 128 values.
    }
  }
}
```

### `AudioWorkletProcessor.process()` method

The actual audio processing happens in the `process()` callback method in the
AudioWorkletProcessor and it must be implemented by user in the class
definition. The WebAudio engine will invoke this function in an isochronous
fashion to feed **inputs** and parameters and fetch **outputs**.

```js
/* AudioWorkletProcessor.process() method */
process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
  // The processor may have multiple inputs and outputs. Get the first input and
  // output.
  const input = inputs[0];
  const output = outputs[0];

  // Each input or output may have multiple channels. Get the first channel.
  const inputChannel0 = input[0];
  const outputChannel0 = output[0];

  // Get the parameter value array.
  const myParamValues = parameters.myParam;

  // if |myParam| has been a constant value during this render quantum, the
  // length of the array would be 1.
  if (myParamValues.length === 1) {
    // Simple gain (multiplication) processing over a render quantum
    // (128 samples). This processor only supports the mono channel.
    for (let i = 0; i < inputChannel0.length; ++i) {
      outputChannel0[i] = inputChannel0[i] * myParamValues[0];
    }
  } else {
    for (let i = 0; i < inputChannel0.length; ++i) {
      outputChannel0[i] = inputChannel0[i] * myParamValues[i];
    }
  }

  // To keep this processor alive.
  return true;
}
```

Additionally, the return value of the `process()` method can be used to
control the lifetime of AudioWorkletNode so that developers can manage
the memory footprint. Returning `false` from `process()` method will mark
the processor inactive and the WebAudio engine will not invoke the method
anymore. To keep the processor alive, the method must return `true`.
Otherwise, the node/processor pair will be garbage collected by the system
eventually.


### Bi-directional Communication with MessagePort

Sometimes custom AudioWorkletNodes will want to expose controls that do
not map to AudioParam. For example, a string-based `type` attribute could
be used to control a custom filter. For this purpose and beyond,
AudioWorkletNode and AudioWorkletProcessor are equipped with a
MessagePort for bi-directional communication. Any kind of custom data
can be exchanged through this channel.

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/12/webaudio-3.svg">

MessagePort can be accessed via `.port` attribute on both the node and
the processor. The node's `port.postMessage()` method sends a message to
the associated processor's `port.onmessage` handler and vice versa.

```js
/* The code in the main global scope. */
context.audioWorklet.addModule('processors.js').then(() => {
  let node = new AudioWorkletNode(context, 'port-processor');
  node.port.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Handling data from the processor.
    console.log(event.data);
  };

  node.port.postMessage('Hello!');
});
```

```js
/* "processor.js" file. */
class PortProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.port.onmessage = (event) => {
      // Handling data from the node.
      console.log(event.data);
    };

    this.port.postMessage('Hi!');
  }

  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    // Do nothing, producing silent output.
    return true;
  }
}

registerProcessor('port-processor', PortProcessor);
```

Also note that MessagePort supports Transferable, which allows you to
transfer data storage or a WASM module over the thread boundary. This opens
up countless possibility on how the Audio Worklet system can be utilized.


## Walkthrough: building a GainNode

Putting everything together, here's a complete example of GainNode built on
top of AudioWorkletNode and AudioWorkletProcessor.

Index.html

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<script>
  const context = new AudioContext();

  // Loads module script via AudioWorklet.
  context.audioWorklet.addModule('gain-processor.js').then(() => {
    let oscillator = new OscillatorNode(context);

    // After the resolution of module loading, an AudioWorkletNode can be
    // constructed.
    let gainWorkletNode = new AudioWorkletNode(context, 'gain-processor');

    // AudioWorkletNode can be interoperable with other native AudioNodes.
    oscillator.connect(gainWorkletNode).connect(context.destination);
    oscillator.start();
  });
</script>
</html>
```

gain-processor.js

```js
class GainProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {

  // Custom AudioParams can be defined with this static getter.
  static get parameterDescriptors() {
    return [{ name: 'gain', defaultValue: 1 }];
  }

  constructor() {
    // The super constructor call is required.
    super();
  }

  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    const input = inputs[0];
    const output = outputs[0];
    const gain = parameters.gain;
    for (let channel = 0; channel < input.length; ++channel) {
      const inputChannel = input[channel];
      const outputChannel = output[channel];
      if (gain.length === 1) {
        for (let i = 0; i < inputChannel.length; ++i)
          outputChannel[i] = inputChannel[i] * gain[0];
      } else {
        for (let i = 0; i < inputChannel.length; ++i)
          outputChannel[i] = inputChannel[i] * gain[i];
      }
    }

    return true;
  }
}

registerProcessor('gain-processor', GainProcessor);
```
