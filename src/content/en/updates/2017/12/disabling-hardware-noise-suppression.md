# Disabling hardware noise suppression {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/ossu.html" %}

In Chrome 64 we're trying a new behavior for getUserMedia audio streams that
have the `echoCancellation` constraint enabled. What's new is that such streams
will temporarily disable hardware noise suppression for the duration of the
stream. We anticipate this will make the echo canceller perform better. As this 
functionality is experimental, it needs to be explicitly turned on; [see
below](#heading-experiment).

At this point, this behavior is only supported for certain input devices and
only on macOS. Support is limited to devices which have togglable “ambient noise
reduction” in the _Sound_ panel of _System Preferences_.

## Background

An echo canceller tries to remove any sound played out on the speakers from the
audio signal that's picked up by the microphone. Without this, what you're
saying as one party of a call, will be picked up by the microphone of the other
parties and then sent back to you. You'll hear an echo of yourself!

To be successful in removing echo, WebRTC’s echo canceller (which is used in
Chrome) needs to get as clean an audio signal as possible from the
microphone. Processing that's applied _before_ the audio reaches the echo
canceller, such as hardware noise suppression, will normally impede its
performance. Moreover, there is already software noise suppression in place, but
only _after_ the echo canceller has done its processing.

## Details of the new behavior

Web developers can enable the new behavior on their sites by opting in to an
[Origin Trial](https://bit.ly/OriginTrials){: .external}. End users can enable
it globally by passing a command-line flag when starting Chrome. For more
information, [see below](#heading-experiment).

When this is enabled, and a web page calls getUserMedia to get audio from an
input device, the following happens:

* If the `echoCancellation` constraint is enabled, hardware noise suppression will
  be turned off for the duration of the newly created audio stream.

* Since this setting is system-wide this will apply to all audio input streams
  from the same device (i.e. the same microphone).

* Once the last stream that wants hardware noise suppression turned off closes,
  hardware noise suppression is turned back on.

* If hardware noise suppression was already disabled beforehand, Chrome will not
  change its state.

* If getUserMedia is called without `echoCancellation` enabled, Chrome will not
  touch hardware noise suppression.

As this setting is also user-controllable, there are some specific interactions
with the user:

* If Chrome has turned hardware noise suppression off, and the user turns it
  back on, Chrome will not attempt to disable it again for that stream.

* If Chrome has turned hardware noise suppression off, and the user turns it
  back on, then off again, Chrome will still re-enable it once the stream ends.

The behavior takes effect by simply enabling the experiment. There are no API
changes necessary.

## How to enable the experiment {: #heading-experiment }

To get this new behavior on your site, your need to be [signed
up](http://bit.ly/OriginTrialSignup){: .external} for the "Disable Hardware
Noise Suppression" [Origin Trial](https://bit.ly/OriginTrials). If you just want
to try it out locally, it can also be enabled on the command line:

    chrome --enable-blink-features=DisableHardwareNoiseSuppression

Passing this flag on the command-line enables the feature globally for the
current session.

There are a couple of aspects we wish to evaluate with this experiment:

* Qualitative differences, in the field, between having hardware noise
  suppression turned on vs. off.

* How does changing this setting from within Chrome affect the end user and
  other software they may be running?

We are interested in feedback on both of these aspects. Are calls better or
worse with this feature turned on? Are there problems with the implementation
that causes unexpected behaviors? In any case, if you're trying this out, please
file feedback on [this
bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=795263){: .external}.
If possible, include what microphone / headset / etc. was used and if it
supports ambient noise reduction. If doing more large-scale experiments, links
to comparative statistics on audio call quality are appreciated.
