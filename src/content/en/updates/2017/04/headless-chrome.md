### TL;DR {: #tldr .hide-from-toc}

[Headless Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md)
is shipping in Chrome 59. It's a way to run the Chrome browser in a headless environment.
Essentially, running
Chrome without chrome! It brings **all modern web platform features** provided
by Chromium and the Blink rendering engine to the command line.

Why is that useful?

A headless browser is a great tool for automated testing and server environments where you
don't need a visible UI shell. For example, you may want to run some tests against
a real web page, create a PDF of it, or just inspect how the browser renders an URL.

Caution: Headless mode is available on Mac and Linux in **Chrome 59**.
[Windows support](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=686608)
is coming in Chrome 60. To check what version of Chrome you have, open
`chrome://version`.

## Starting Headless (CLI) {: #cli }

The easiest way to get started with headless mode is to open the Chrome binary
from the command line. If you've got Chrome 59+ installed, start Chrome with the `--headless` flag:

    chrome \
      --headless \                   # Runs Chrome in headless mode.
      --disable-gpu \                # Temporarily needed for now.
      --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
      https://www.chromestatus.com   # URL to open. Defaults to about:blank.

Note: Right now, you'll also want to include the `--disable-gpu` flag.
That will eventually go away.

`chrome` should point to your installation of Chrome. The exact location will
vary from platform to platform. Since I'm on Mac, I created convenient aliases
for each version of Chrome that I have installed.

If you're on the stable channel of Chrome and cannot get the Beta, I recommend
using `chrome-canary`:

    alias chrome="/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome"
    alias chrome-canary="/Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary"
    alias chromium="/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium"

Download Chrome Canary [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html).

## Command line features {: features }

In some cases, you may not need to [programmatically script](#node) Headless Chrome.
There are some [useful command line flags](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/headless/app/headless_shell_switches.cc)
to perform common tasks.

### Printing the DOM {: dom }

The `--dump-dom` flag prints `document.body.innerHTML` to stdout:

    chrome --headless --disable-gpu --dump-dom https://www.chromestatus.com/

### Create a PDF {: dom }

The `--print-to-pdf` flag creates a PDF of the page:

    chrome --headless --disable-gpu --print-to-pdf https://www.chromestatus.com/

### Taking screenshots {: #screenshots }

To capture a screenshot of a page, use the `--screenshot` flag:

    chrome --headless --disable-gpu --screenshot https://www.chromestatus.com/

    # Size of a standard letterhead.
    chrome --headless --disable-gpu --screenshot --window-size=1280,1696 https://www.chromestatus.com/

    # Nexus 5x
    chrome --headless --disable-gpu --screenshot --window-size=412,732 https://www.chromestatus.com/

Running with `--screenshot` will produce a file named `screenshot.png` in the
current working directory. If you're looking for full page screenshots, things
are a tad more involved. There's a great blog
post from David Schnurr that has you covered. Check out
[Using headless Chrome as an automated screenshot tool
](https://medium.com/@dschnr/using-headless-chrome-as-an-automated-screenshot-tool-4b07dffba79a).

### REPL mode (read-eval-print loop) {: #repl }

The `--repl` flag runs Headless in a mode where you can evaluate JS expressions
in the browser, right from the command line:

    $ chrome --headless --disable-gpu --repl https://www.chromestatus.com/
    [0608/112805.245285:INFO:headless_shell.cc(278)] Type a Javascript expression to evaluate or "quit" to exit.
    >>> location.href
    {"result":{"type":"string","value":"https://www.chromestatus.com/features"}}
    >>> quit
    $

## Debugging Chrome without a browser UI? {: #frontend }

When you run Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, it starts an instance
with the [DevTools protocol][dtviewer] enabled. The
protocol is used to communicate with Chrome and drive the headless
browser instance. It's also what tools like Sublime, VS Code, and Node use for
remote debugging an application. #synergy

Since you don't have browser UI to see the page, navigate to `http://localhost:9222`
in another browser to check that everything is working. You'll see a list of
inspectable pages where you can click through and see what Headless is rendering:

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/04/headless-chrome/remote-debugging-ui.jpg"
       class="screenshot" alt="DevTools Remote">
  <figcaption>DevTools remote debugging UI</figcaption>
</figure>

From here, you can use the familiar DevTools features to inspect, debug, and tweak
the page as you normally would. If you're using Headless programmatically, this
page is also a powerful debugging tool for seeing all the raw DevTools protocol
commands going across the wire, communicating with the browser.

## Using programmatically (Node) {: #node }

### The Puppeteer API {: #puppeteer }

[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) is a Node library
developed by the Chrome team. It provides a high-level API to control headless
(or full) Chrome. It's similar to other automated testing libraries like Phantom
and NightmareJS, but it only works with the latest versions of Chrome.

Among other things, Puppeteer can be used to easily take screenshots, create PDFs,
navigate pages, and fetch information about those pages. I recommend the library
if you want to quickly automate browser testing. It hides away the complexities
of the DevTools protocol and takes care of redundant tasks like launching a
debug instance of Chrome.

Install it:

    yarn add puppeteer

**Example** - print the user agent

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async() => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  console.log(await browser.version());
  browser.close();
})();
```

**Example** - taking a screenshot of the page

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async() => {

const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://www.chromestatus.com', {waitUntil: 'networkidle'});
await page.pdf({path: 'page.pdf', format: 'A4'});

browser.close();
})();
```

Check out [Puppeteer's documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md)
to learn more about the full API.

### The CRI library {: #cri }

[chrome-remote-interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-remote-interface)
is a lower-level library than Puppeteer's API. I recommend it if you want to be
close to the metal and use the [DevTools protocol][dtviewer] directly.

#### Launching Chrome {: #nodelaunch }

chrome-remote-interface doesn't launch Chrome for you, so you'll have to take
care of that yourself.

In the CLI section, we [started Chrome manually](#cli) using
`--headless --remote-debugging-port=9222`. However, to fully automate tests, you'll probably
want to spawn Chrome _from_ your application.

One way is to use `child_process`:

```javascript
const execFile = require('child_process').execFile;

function launchHeadlessChrome(url, callback) {
  // Assuming MacOSx.
  const CHROME = '/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome';
  execFile(CHROME, ['--headless', '--disable-gpu', '--remote-debugging-port=9222', url], callback);
}

launchHeadlessChrome('https://www.chromestatus.com', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
  ...
});
```

But things get tricky if you want a portable solution that works across multiple
platforms. Just look at that hard-coded path to Chrome :(

##### Using ChromeLauncher {: #nodechromelauncher }

[Lighthouse](/web/tools/lighthouse/) is a marvelous
tool for testing the quality of your web apps. A robust module for launching
Chrome was developed within Lighthouse and is now extracted for standalone use.
The [`chrome-launcher` NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-launcher)
will find where
Chrome is installed, set up a debug instance, launch the browser, and kill it
when your program is done. Best part is that it works cross-platform thanks to
Node!

By default, **`chrome-launcher` will try to launch Chrome Canary** (if it's
installed), but you can change that to manually select which Chrome to use. To
use it, first install from npm:

    yarn add chrome-launcher

**Example** - using `chrome-launcher` to launch Headless

```javascript
const chromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');

// Optional: set logging level of launcher to see its output.
// Install it using: yarn add lighthouse-logger
// const log = require('lighthouse-logger');
// log.setLevel('info');

/**
 * Launches a debugging instance of Chrome.
 * @param {boolean=} headless True (default) launches Chrome in headless mode.
 *     False launches a full version of Chrome.
 * @return {Promise<ChromeLauncher>}
 */
function launchChrome(headless=true) {
  return chromeLauncher.launch({
    // port: 9222, // Uncomment to force a specific port of your choice.
    chromeFlags: [
      '--window-size=412,732',
      '--disable-gpu',
      headless ? '--headless' : ''
    ]
  });
}

launchChrome().then(chrome => {
  console.log(`Chrome debuggable on port: ${chrome.port}`);
  ...
  // chrome.kill();
});
```

Running this script doesn't do much, but you should see an instance of
Chrome fire up in the task manager that loaded `about:blank`. Remember, there
won't be any browser UI. We're headless.

To control the browser, we need the DevTools protocol!

#### Retrieving information about the page {: #useprotocol }

Warning: The DevTools protocol can do a ton of interesting stuff, but it can be a bit
daunting at first. I recommend spending a bit of time browsing the
[DevTools Protocol Viewer][dtviewer], first. Then, move on to the
`chrome-remote-interface` API docs to see how it wraps the raw protocol.

Let's install the library:

    yarn add chrome-remote-interface

##### Examples

**Example** - print the user agent

```javascript
const CDP = require('chrome-remote-interface');

...

launchChrome().then(async chrome => {
  const version = await CDP.Version({port: chrome.port});
  console.log(version['User-Agent']);
});
```

Results in something like: `HeadlessChrome/60.0.3082.0`

**Example** - check if the site has a [web app manifest](/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest)

```javascript
const CDP = require('chrome-remote-interface');

...

(async function() {

const chrome = await launchChrome();
const protocol = await CDP({port: chrome.port});

// Extract the DevTools protocol domains we need and enable them.
// See API docs: https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/
const {Page} = protocol;
await Page.enable();

Page.navigate({url: 'https://www.chromestatus.com/'});

// Wait for window.onload before doing stuff.
Page.loadEventFired(async () => {
  const manifest = await Page.getAppManifest();

  if (manifest.url) {
    console.log('Manifest: ' + manifest.url);
    console.log(manifest.data);
  } else {
    console.log('Site has no app manifest');
  }

  protocol.close();
  chrome.kill(); // Kill Chrome.
});

})();
```

**Example** - extract the `<title>` of the page using DOM APIs.

```javascript
const CDP = require('chrome-remote-interface');

...

(async function() {

const chrome = await launchChrome();
const protocol = await CDP({port: chrome.port});

// Extract the DevTools protocol domains we need and enable them.
// See API docs: https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/
const {Page, Runtime} = protocol;
await Promise.all([Page.enable(), Runtime.enable()]);

Page.navigate({url: 'https://www.chromestatus.com/'});

// Wait for window.onload before doing stuff.
Page.loadEventFired(async () => {
  const js = "document.querySelector('title').textContent";
  // Evaluate the JS expression in the page.
  const result = await Runtime.evaluate({expression: js});

  console.log('Title of page: ' + result.result.value);

  protocol.close();
  chrome.kill(); // Kill Chrome.
});

})();
```

## Using Selenium, WebDriver, and ChromeDriver {: #drivers }

Right now, Selenium opens a full instance of Chrome. In other words, it's an
automated solution but not completely headless. However, Selenium can be
configured to run headless Chrome with a little work. I recommend
[Running Selenium with Headless Chrome](https://intoli.com/blog/running-selenium-with-headless-chrome/)
if you want the
full instructions on how to set things up yourself, but I've dropped in some
examples below to get you started.

#### Using ChromeDriver

[ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) 2.32
uses Chrome 61 and works well with headless Chrome.

Install:

```
yarn add selenium-webdriver chromedriver
```

Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
const chromedriver = require('chromedriver');

const chromeCapabilities = webdriver.Capabilities.chrome();
chromeCapabilities.set('chromeOptions', {args: ['--headless']});

const driver = new webdriver.Builder()
  .forBrowser('chrome')
  .withCapabilities(chromeCapabilities)
  .build();

// Navigate to google.com, enter a search.
driver.get('https://www.google.com/');
driver.findElement({name: 'q'}).sendKeys('webdriver');
driver.findElement({name: 'btnG'}).click();
driver.wait(webdriver.until.titleIs('webdriver - Google Search'), 1000);

// Take screenshot of results page. Save to disk.
driver.takeScreenshot().then(base64png => {
  fs.writeFileSync('screenshot.png', new Buffer(base64png, 'base64'));
});

driver.quit();
```

#### Using WebDriverIO

[WebDriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) is a higher level API on top of Selenium WebDriver.

Install:

```
yarn add webdriverio chromedriver
```

Example: filter CSS features on chromestatus.com

```javascript
const webdriverio = require('webdriverio');
const chromedriver = require('chromedriver');

const PORT = 9515;

chromedriver.start([
  '--url-base=wd/hub',
  `--port=${PORT}`,
  '--verbose'
]);

(async () => {

const opts = {
  port: PORT,
  desiredCapabilities: {
    browserName: 'chrome',
    chromeOptions: {args: ['--headless']}
  }
};

const browser = webdriverio.remote(opts).init();

await browser.url('https://www.chromestatus.com/features');

const title = await browser.getTitle();
console.log(`Title: ${title}`);

await browser.waitForText('.num-features', 3000);
let numFeatures = await browser.getText('.num-features');
console.log(`Chrome has ${numFeatures} total features`);

await browser.setValue('input[type="search"]', 'CSS');
console.log('Filtering features...');
await browser.pause(1000);

numFeatures = await browser.getText('.num-features');
console.log(`Chrome has ${numFeatures} CSS features`);

const buffer = await browser.saveScreenshot('screenshot.png');
console.log('Saved screenshot...');

chromedriver.stop();
browser.end();

})();
```

## FAQ

**Do I need the `--disable-gpu` flag?**

Yes, for now.  The `--disable-gpu` flag is a temporary requirement to work around a few bugs.
You won't need this flag in future versions of Chrome. See [https://crbug.com/546953#c152](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=546953#c152) and [https://crbug.com/695212](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=695212) for more information.

**So I still need Xvfb?**

No. Headless Chrome doesn't use a window so a display server like Xvfb is
no longer needed. You can happily run your automated tests without it.

What is Xvfb? Xvfb is an in-memory display server for Unix-like systems that enables you
to run graphical applications (like Chrome) without an attached physical display.
Many people use Xvfb to run earlier versions of Chrome to do "headless" testing.

**How do I create a Docker container that runs Headless Chrome?**

Check out [lighthouse-ci](https://github.com/ebidel/lighthouse-ci). It has an
[example Dockerfile](https://github.com/ebidel/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/builder/Dockerfile.headless)
that uses Ubuntu as a base image, and installs + runs Lighthouse in an App Engine
Flexible container.

**Can I use this with Selenium / WebDriver / ChromeDriver**?

Yes. See [Using Selenium, WebDrive, or ChromeDriver](#drivers).

**How is this related to PhantomJS?**

Headless Chrome is similar to tools like [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/). Both
can be used for automated testing in a headless environment. The main difference
between the two is that Phantom uses an older version of WebKit as its rendering
engine while Headless Chrome uses the latest version of Blink.

At the moment, Phantom also provides a higher level API than the [DevTools protocol][dtviewer].

**Where do I report bugs?**

For bugs against Headless Chrome, file them on [crbug.com](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?components=Blink&blocking=705916&cc=skyostil%40chromium.org&Proj=Headless).

For bugs in the DevTools protocol, file them at [github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/issues/new).
