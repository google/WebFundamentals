  entire page, from the top of the viewport to the bottom.
* [**Block requests**](#block-requests). Manually disable individual
  requests in the Network panel.

## New features {: #new-features }

### CSS and JS code coverage {: #coverage }

Find unused CSS and JS code with the new **Coverage** tab. When you load or
run a page, the tab tells you how much code was used, versus how much was
loaded. You can reduce the size of your pages by only shipping the code
that you need.

Clicking on a URL reveals that file in the **Sources** panel with a breakdown
of which lines of code executed.

</figure>

Each line of code is color-coded:

* Solid green means that line of code executed.
* Solid red means it did not execute.
* A line of code that is both red and green, such as line 3 in **Figure 2**,
  means that only some code on that line executed. For example, a ternary
  expression like `var b = (a > 0) ? a : 0` is colored both red and green.

Note: The color-coding is likely to change in future Chrome releases.

To open the **Coverage** tab:

1. Open the [Command Menu][CM].
1. Start typing `Coverage` and select **Show Coverage**.

### Full-page screenshots {: #screenshots }

Check out the video below to learn how to take a screenshot from the top
of the page, all the way to the bottom.

  </iframe>
</div>

### Block requests {: #block-requests }

Want to see how your page behaves when a particular script, stylesheet, or
other resource isn't available? Right-click on the request in the **Network**
panel and select **Block Request URL**. A new **Request blocking** tab
pops up in the Drawer, which lets you manage blocked requests.

### Step over async await {: #async }

Up until now, trying to step through code like the snippet below was a
headache. You'd be in the middle of `test()`, stepping over a line, and then
you'd get interrupted by the `setInterval()` code. Now, when you step through
async code like `test()`, DevTools steps from the first to last line with
consistency.

    function wait(ms) {
      return new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms)).then(() => "Yay");
    }
    
    // do some work in background.
    setInterval(() => 42, 200);
    
    async function test() {
      debugger;
      const hello = "world";
      const response = await fetch('index.html');
      const tmp = await wait(1000);
      console.log(tmp);
      return hello;
    }
    
    async function runTest() {
      let result = await test();
      console.log(result);
    }

## Changes {: #changes }

### Unified Command Menu {: #command-menu }

When you open the [Command Menu][CM] now, notice that your command
is prepended with a greater-than character (`>`). This is because the Command
Menu has been unified with the **Open File** menu, which is
<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> (Mac), or <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(Windows, Linux).
