# Upcoming Regular Expression Features {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/jgruber.html" %}

ES2015 introduced many new features to the JavaScript language, including
significant improvements to the regular expression syntax with the Unicode
(`/u`) and sticky (`/y`) flags. But development has not stopped since then. In
tight collaboration with other members at TC39 (the ECMAScript standards body),
the V8 team has proposed and co-designed several new features to make regular
expressions even more powerful.

These features are currently being proposed for inclusion in the JavaScript
specification. Even though the proposals have not been fully accepted, they are
already at [Stage 3 in the TC39
process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/). We have implemented these
features behind a flag (see below) in order to be able to provide timely design
and implementation feedback to the respective proposal authors before the
specification is finalized.

This blog post gives you a preview of this exciting future. If you'd like to
follow along with the upcoming examples, enable experimental JavaScript
features at `chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`.


## Named Captures

Regular expressions can contain so-called captures (or groups), which can
capture a portion of the matched text. So far, developers could only refer to
these captures by their index, which is determined by the position of the
capture within the pattern.

```js
const pattern = /(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/u;
const result = pattern.exec('2017-07-10');
// result[0] === '2017-07-10'
// result[1] === '2017'
// result[2] === '07'
// result[3] === '10'
```

But regular expressions are already notoriously difficult to read, write, and
maintain, and numeric references can add further complications. For instance,
in longer patterns it can be tricky to determine the index of a particular
capture:

```js
/(?:(.)(.(?<=[^(])(.)))/  // Index of the last capture?
```

And even worse, changes to a pattern can potentially shift the indices of all
existing captures:

```js
/(a)(b)(c)\3\2\1/     // A few simple numbered backreferences.
/(.)(a)(b)(c)\4\3\2/  // All need to be updated.
```

Named captures are an upcoming feature that helps mitigate these issues by
allowing developers to assign names to captures. The syntax is similar to Perl,
Java, .Net, and Ruby:

```js
const pattern = /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/u;
const result = pattern.exec('2017-07-10');
// result.groups.year === '2017'
// result.groups.month === '07'
// result.groups.day === '10'
```

Named captures can also be referenced by named backreferences and through
`String.prototype.replace`:

```js
// Named backreferences.
/(?<LowerCaseX>x)y\k<LowerCaseX>/.test('xyx');  // true

// String replacement.
const pattern = /(?<fst>a)(?<snd>b)/;
'ab'.replace(pattern, '$<snd>$<fst>');                              // 'ba'
'ab'.replace(pattern, (m, p1, p2, o, s, {fst, snd}) => fst + snd);  // 'ba'
```

Full details of this new feature are available in the [specification
proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-named-groups).


## dotAll Flag

By default, the `.` atom in regular expressions matches any character except
for line terminators:

```js
/foo.bar/u.test('foo\nbar');   // false
```

A proposal introduces dotAll mode, enabled through the `/s` flag. In dotAll
mode, `.` matches line terminators as well.

```js
/foo.bar/su.test('foo\nbar');  // true
```

Full details of this new feature are available in the [specification
proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-dotall-flag).


## Unicode Property Escapes

Regular expression syntax has always included shorthands for certain character
classes. `\d` represent digits and is really just `[0-9]`; `\w` is short for
word characters, or `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.

With Unicode awareness introduced in ES2015, there are suddenly many more
characters that could be considered numbers, for example the circled digit one:
①; or considered word characters, for example the Chinese character for snow:
雪.

Neither of these can be matched with `\d` or `\w`. Changing the meaning of
these shorthands would break existing regular expression patterns.

Instead, new character classes are being
[introduced](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes).
Note that they are only available for Unicode-aware regular expressions denoted
by the `/u` flag.

```js
/\p{Number}/u.test('①');      // true
/\p{Alphabetic}/u.test('雪');  // true
```

The inverse can be matched by with `\P`.

```js
/\P{Number}/u.test('①');      // false
/\P{Alphabetic}/u.test('雪');  // false
```

The Unicode consortium defines many more ways to classify code points, for
example math symbols or Japanese Hiragana characters:

```js
/^\p{Math}+$/u.test('∛∞∉');                            // true
/^\p{Script_Extensions=Hiragana}+$/u.test('ひらがな');  // true
```

The full list of supported Unicode property classes can be found in the current
[specification
proposal](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes/#sec-static-semantics-unicodematchproperty-p).

article](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es-unicode-property-escapes).


## Lookbehind Assertions

Lookahead assertions have been part of JavaScript’s regular expression syntax
from the start. Their counterpart, lookbehind assertions, are finally being
[introduced](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-lookbehind). Some of you
may remember that this has been part of V8 for quite some time already. We even
use lookbehind asserts under the hood to implement the Unicode flag specified
in ES2015.

The name already describes its meaning pretty well. It offers a way to restrict
a pattern to only match if preceded by the pattern in the lookbehind group. It
comes in both matching and non-matching flavors:

```js
/(?<=\$)\d+/.exec('$1 is worth about ¥123');  // ['1']
/(?<!\$)\d+/.exec('$1 is worth about ¥123');  // ['123']
```

For more details, check out our [previous blog
post](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/02/regexp-lookbehind-assertions.html)
dedicated to lookbehind assertions, and examples in related [V8 test
cases](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/test/mjsunit/harmony/regexp-lookbehind.js).


## Acknowledgements

This blog post wouldn’t be complete without mentioning some of the people that
have worked hard to make this happen: especially language champions [Mathias
Bynens](https://twitter.com/mathias), [Dan
Ehrenberg](https://twitter.com/littledan), [Claude
Pache](https://github.com/claudepache), [Brian
Terlson](https://twitter.com/bterlson), [Thomas
Wood](https://twitter.com/IgnoredAmbience), Gorkem Yakin, and Irregexp guru
[Erik Corry](https://twitter.com/erikcorry); but also everyone else who has
contributed to the language specification and V8’s implementation of these
features.

We hope you’re as excited about these new regular expression features as we
are!
