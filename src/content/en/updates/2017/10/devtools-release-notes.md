{% include "web/_shared/contributors/kaycebasques.html" %}

Note: The video version of these release notes will be published around
early-December 2017.

Welcome back! New features coming to DevTools in Chrome 63 include:

* [Multi-client remote debugging support](#multi-client).
* [Workspaces 2.0](#workspaces).
* [Four new audits](#audits).
* [Simulate push notifications with custom data](#push).
* [Trigger background sync events with custom tags](#sync).

Note: You can check what version of Chrome you're running at
`chrome://version`. Chrome auto-updates to a new major version about every 6
weeks.

## Multi-client remote debugging support {: #multi-client }

If you've ever tried debugging an app from an IDE like VS Code or WebStorm,
you've probably discovered that opening DevTools messes up your debug session.
This issue also made it impossible to use DevTools to debug WebDriver tests.

As of Chrome 63, DevTools now supports multiple remote debugging clients
by default, no configuration needed.

Multi-client remote debugging was the [number 1 most-popular DevTools issue
on crbug.com][Crbug], and number 3 across the entire Chromium project.
Multi-client support also  opens up quite a few interesting opportunities
for integrating other tools with DevTools, or using those tools in new
ways. For example:

[Crbug]: https://crbug.com/129539

* Protocol clients such as ChromeDriver or the Chrome debugging extensions for VS Code and 
Webstorm, and WebSocket clients such as Puppeteer, can now run at the same time as DevTools.
* Two separate WebSocket protocol clients, such as 
[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) or 
[chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface), can now
  connect to the same tab simultaneously.
* Chrome Extensions using the `chrome.debugger` API can now run at the same
  time as DevTools.
* Multiple different Chrome Extensions can now use the `chrome.debugger` API
  on the same tab simultaneously.

## Workspaces 2.0 {: #workspaces }

Workspaces have been around for some time in DevTools. This feature enables
you to use DevTools as your IDE. You make some changes to your source code
within DevTools, and the changes persist to the local version of your
project on your file system.

Workspaces 2.0 builds off of 1.0, adding a more helpful UX and improved
auto-mapping of transpiled code.
This feature was originally scheduled to be released shortly after
Chrome Developer Summit (CDS) 2016, but the team postponed it to sort out
some issues.

Check out the "Authoring" part (around 14:28) of the DevTools talk from
CDS 2016 to see Workspaces 2.0 in action.

## Four new audits {: #audits }

In Chrome 63 the **Audits** panel has 4 new audits:

* Serve images as WebP.
* Use images with appropriate aspect ratios.
* Avoid frontend JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities.
* Browser errors logged to the Console.

See [Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools][Audits] to learn how to use the
**Audits** panel to improve the quality of your pages.

## Simulate push notifications with custom data {: #push }

Simulating push notifications has been around for a while in DevTools,
with one limitation: you couldn't send custom data. But with
the new **Push** text box coming to the **Service Worker** pane in Chrome 63,
now you can. Try it now:

1. Go to [Simple Push Demo](https://gauntface.github.io/simple-push-demo/).
1. Click **Enable Push Notifications**.
1. Click **Allow** when Chrome prompts you to allow notifications.
1. Open DevTools.
1. Go to the **Service Workers** pane.
1. Write something in the **Push** text box.

1. Click **Push** to send the notification.

## Trigger background sync events with custom tags {: #sync }

Triggering background sync events has also been in the **Service Workers**
pane for some time, but now you can send custom tags:

1. Open DevTools.
1. Go to the **Service Workers** pane.
1. Enter some text in the **Sync** text box.
1. Click **Sync**.

    <b>Figure 3</b>. After clicking <b>Sync</b>, DevTools sends a background
    sync event with the custom tag <code>update-content</code> to the service
    worker
