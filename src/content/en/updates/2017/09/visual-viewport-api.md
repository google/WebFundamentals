# Introducing visualViewport {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/jakearchibald.html" %}

What if I told you, there's more than one viewport.

*BRRRRAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM*

And the viewport you're using right now, is actually a viewport within a
viewport.

*BRRRRAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM*

And sometimes, the data the DOM gives you, refers to one of those viewport and
not the other.

*BRRRRAAAAM…* wait what?

It's true, take a look:

## Layout viewport vs visual viewport

<style>
.phone-video {
  padding-bottom: 90%;
}
</style>

<div class="video-wrapper-full-width phone-video">
  <iframe class="devsite-embedded-youtube-video" data-video-id="S38WTbtgqlY"
          data-autohide="1" data-showinfo="0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

The video above shows a web page being scrolled and pinch-zoomed, along with a
mini-map on the right showing the position of viewports within the page.

Things are pretty straight forward during regular scrolling. The green area
represents the *layout viewport*, which `position: fixed` items stick to.

Things get weird when pinch-zooming is introduced. The red box represents the
*visual viewport*, which is the part of the page we can actually see. This
viewport can move around while `position: fixed` elements remain where they
were, attached to the layout viewport. If we pan at a boundary of the layout
viewport, it drags the layout viewport along with it.

## Improving compatibility

Unfortunately web APIs are inconsistent in terms of which viewport they refer
to, and they're also inconsistent across browsers.

For instance, `element.getBoundingClientRect().y` returns the offset within the
*layout viewport*. That's cool, but we often want the position within the page,
so we write:

    element.getBoundingClientRect().y + window.scrollY

However, many browsers use the *visual viewport* for `window.scrollY`, meaning
the above code breaks when the user pinch-zooms.

Chrome 61 changes `window.scrollY` to refer to the layout viewport instead,
meaning the above code works even when pinch-zoomed. In fact, browsers are
slowly changing all positional properties to refer to the layout viewport.

With the exception of one new property…

## Exposing the visual viewport to script

A new API exposes the visual viewport as `window.visualViewport`. It's a [draft
spec](https://wicg.github.io/ViewportAPI/spec.html), with [cross-browser
approval](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5737866978131968), and it's
landing in Chrome 61.

    console.log(window.visualViewport.width);

Here's what `window.visualViewport` gives us:

<table class="responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan=2><code>visualViewport</code> properties</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>offsetLeft</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Distance between the left edge of the visual viewport, and the layout
        viewport, in CSS pixels.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>offsetTop</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Distance between the top edge of the visual viewport, and the layout
        viewport, in CSS pixels.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>pageLeft</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Distance between the left edge of the visual viewport, and the left
        boundary of the document, in CSS pixels.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>pageTop</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Distance between the top edge of the visual viewport, and the top
        boundary of the document, in CSS pixels.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>width</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Width of the visual viewport in CSS pixels.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>height</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Height of the visual viewport in CSS pixels.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>scale</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        The scale applied by pinch-zooming. If content is twice the size due to
        zooming, this would return <code>2</code>. This is not affected by
        <code>devicePixelRatio</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

There are also a couple of events:

    window.visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', listener);

<table class="responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan=2><code>visualViewport</code> events</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>resize</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Fired when <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, or
        <code>scale</code> changes.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>scroll</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Fired when <code>offsetLeft</code> or <code>offsetTop</code> changes.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Demo

The video at the start of this article was created using `visualViewport`,
[check it out in Chrome 61+](https://visual-viewport.glitch.me/). It uses
`visualViewport` to make the mini-map stick to the top-right of the visual
viewport, and applies an inverse scale so it always appears the same size,
despite pinch-zooming.

## Gotchas

### Events only fire when the visual viewport changes

It feels like an obvious thing to state, but it caught me out when I first
played with `visualViewport`.

If the layout viewport resizes but the visual viewport doesn't, you don't get a
`resize` event. However, it's unusual for the layout viewport to resize without
the visual viewport also changing width/height.

The real gotcha is scrolling. If scrolling occurs, but the visual viewport
remains static *relative to the layout viewport*, you don't get a `scroll` event
on `visualViewport`, and this is really common. During regular document
scrolling, the visual viewport stays locked to the top-left of the layout
viewport, so `scroll` *does not fire* on `visualViewport`.

If you're wanting to hear about all changes to the visual viewport, including
`pageTop` and `pageLeft`, you'll have to listen to the window's scroll event
too:

    visualViewport.addEventListener('scroll', update);
    visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', update);
    window.addEventListener('scroll', update);

### Avoid duplicating work with multiple listeners

Similar to listening to `scroll` & `resize` on the window, you're likely to call
some kind of "update" function as a result. However, it's common for many of
these events to happen at the same time. If the user resizes the window, it'll
trigger `resize`, but quite often `scroll` too. To improve performance, avoid
handling the change multiple times:

    // Add listeners
    visualViewport.addEventListener('scroll', update);
    visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', update);
    addEventListener('scroll', update);

    let pendingUpdate = false;

    function update() {
      // If we're already going to handle an update, return
      if (pendingUpdate) return;

      pendingUpdate = true;

      // Use requestAnimationFrame so the update happens before next render
      requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        pendingUpdate = false;

        // Handle update here
      });
    }

[I've filed a spec issue for
this](https://github.com/WICG/ViewportAPI/issues/44), as I think there may be a
better way, such as a single `update` event.

### Event handlers don't work

[Due to a Chrome
bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=760916), this *does
not work*:

<p><span class="compare-worse">Buggy</span> – uses an event handler</p>

    visualViewport.onscroll = () => console.log('scroll!');

Instead:

<p><span class="compare-better">Works</span> – uses an event listener</p>

    visualViewport.addEventListener('scroll', () => console.log('scroll'));

### Offset values are rounded

I think (well, I hope) this is [another Chrome
bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=760936).

`offsetLeft` and `offsetTop` are rounded, which is pretty inaccurate once the
user has zoomed in. You can see the issues with this during [the
demo](https://visual-viewport.glitch.me/) – if the user zooms in and pans
slowly, the [mini-map snaps between unzoomed
pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9TXSciTxkc).

### The event rate is slow

Like other `resize` and `scroll` events, these no not fire every frame,
especially on mobile. You can see this during [the
demo](https://visual-viewport.glitch.me/) – once you pinch zoom, the mini-map
has trouble staying locked to the viewport.

## Accessibility

In [the demo](https://visual-viewport.glitch.me/) I used `visualViewport` to
counteract the user's pinch-zoom. It makes sense for this particular demo, but
you should think carefully before doing anything that overrides the user's
desire to zoom in.

`visualViewport` can be used to improve accessibility. For instance, if the user
is zooming in, you may choose to hide decorative `position: fixed` items, to get
them out of the user's way. But again, be careful you're not hiding something
the user is trying to get a closer look at.

You could consider posting to an analytics service when the user zooms in. This
could help you identify pages that users are having difficulty with at the
default zoom level.

    visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', () => {
      if (visualViewport.scale > 1) {
        // Post data to analytics service
      }
    });

And that's it! `visualViewport` is a nice little API which solves compatibility
issues along the way.
