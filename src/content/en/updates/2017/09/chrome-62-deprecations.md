# Deprecations and Removals in Chrome 62 {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/josephmedley.html" %}

In nearly every version of Chrome, we see a significant number of updates and
improvements to the product, its performance, and also capabilities of the Web
Platform. This article describes the deprecations and removals in Chrome 62,
which is in beta as of September 14. This list is subject to change at any time.

## Remove RTCPeerConnection.getStreamById()

Nearly two years ago, `getStreamById()` was [removed from the WebRTC
spec](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/pull/18). Most other browsers have
already removed this from their implementations, and the feature was deprecated
in Chrome 60. Though this function is believed to be little-used, it's also
believed there is some minor interoperability risk with Edge and WebKit-based
browsers *other than* Safari where `getStreamById()` is still supported.
Developers needing an alternative implementation can find example code in the
Intent to Remove, below.

## Remove SharedWorker.workerStart

This property, which was intended for use in monitoring worker performance was
removed from the spec more than two years ago and it is not supported in the
other major browsers. A more modern approach to tracking performance of a worker
would use
[`Performance.timing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timing).

## Remove SVGPathElement.getPathSegAtLength()

In Chrome 48, `SVGPathElement.pathSegList()` and related interfaces were removed
in compliance with the [SVG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/). At that
time, this method was mistakenly left in. We don't expect this removal to break
any web pages since, for the last two years, it has returned an object that no
longer exists in Blink.

### Remove usage of notifications from insecure iframes

Note: Removal was originally expected in Chrome 61.

Permission requests from iframes can confuse users since it is difficult to
distinguish between the containing page's origin and the origin of the iframe
that is making the request. When the requests scope is unclear, it is difficult
for users to judge whether to grant or deny permission.

Disallowing notifications in iframes will also align the requirements for
notification permission with that of push notifications, easing friction for
developers.

Developers who need this functionality can open a new window to request
notification permission.
