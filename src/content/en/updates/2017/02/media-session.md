# Customize Media Metadata & Controls {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/beaufortfrancois.html" %}

With the brand new [Media Session API], the ability to **set the artist, album,
title, and artwork** of the media (audio or video) you're playing in your web
app is now possible in Chrome 57 (beta in January 2017, stable in March 2017).
It also allows you to **respond to media control events** (play, pause, etc.)
which may come from notifications or media keys.

## Gimme What I Want

You already know all about the Media Session API and are simply coming back to
copy and paste with no shame some boilerplate code? So here it is.

    if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {

      navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
        title: 'Never Gonna Give You Up',
        album: 'Whenever You Need Somebody',
        artist: 'Rick Astley',
        artwork: [
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/96x96',   sizes: '96x96',   type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/128x128', sizes: '128x128', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/192x192', sizes: '192x192', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/256x256', sizes: '256x256', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/384x384', sizes: '384x384', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/512x512', sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/png' },
        ]
      });

      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('play', function() {});
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('pause', function() {});
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekbackward', function() {});
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekforward', function() {});
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('previoustrack', function() {});
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('nexttrack', function() {});
    }

## Get into the code

### Let's play ðŸŽ·

Add a simple `<audio>` tag to your web page and assign several media sources so
that the browser can choose which one works best.

    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3"/>
      <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>
    </audio>

Note: I could have used a `<video>` tag as well there to showcase the Media
Session API.

As you may know, `autoplay` is disabled on Chrome for Android which
means we have to use the `play()` method of the audio element there. This
method must be triggered by [a user gesture] such as a touch or a mouse click.
We're talking about listening to
[`pointerup`](/web/updates/2016/10/pointer-events), `click`, and `touchend`
events. In other words, the user must click on a button before your web app can
actually make some noise.

    playButton.addEventListener('pointerup', function(event) {
      let audio = document.querySelector('audio');

      // User interacted with the page. Let's play audio...
      audio.play()
      .then(_ => { /* Set up Media Session... */ })
      .catch(error => { console.log(error) });
    });

If you don't want to play audio right after the first interaction, I recommend
you use the `load()` method of the audio element.

<pre class="prettyprint">

let audio = document.querySelector('audio');

welcomeButton.addEventListener('pointerup', function(event) {
  // User interacted with the page. Let's load audio...
  <strong>audio.load()</strong>
  .then(_ => { /* Show play button for instance... */ })
  .catch(error => { console.log(error) });
});

// Later...
playButton.addEventListener('pointerup', function(event) {
  <strong>audio.play()</strong>
  .then(_ => { /* Set up Media Session... */ })
  .catch(error => { console.log(error) });
});

</pre>

### Customize the notification

When your web app is playing audio, you can already see a media notification
sitting in the notification tray. On Android, Chrome does its best there to show
appropriate information by using the document's title and the largest favicon
it can find.

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<div class="attempt-left">
  <figure>
    <img src="https://placehold.it/350x350?text=With no Media Session" alt="TODO">
    <figcaption>With no Media Session</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure>
    <img src="https://placehold.it/350x350?text=With Media Session" alt="TODO">
    <figcaption>With Media Session</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Let's see how to customize this media notification by setting some media
session metadata such as the title, album, artist, and artwork with the Media
Session API.

    if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {

      navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
        title: 'Never Gonna Give You Up',
        album: 'Whenever You Need Somebody',
        artist: 'Rick Astley',
        artwork: [
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/96x96',   sizes: '96x96',   type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/128x128', sizes: '128x128', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/192x192', sizes: '192x192', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/256x256', sizes: '256x256', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/384x384', sizes: '384x384', type: 'image/png' },
          { src: 'https://dummyimage.com/512x512', sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/png' },
        ]
      });
    }

If your web app provides a playlist for instance, you may want to allow the
user to navigate through your playlist directly from the media notification
with some "Previous Track" and "Next Track" icons.

    let audio = document.createElement('audio');

    let playlist = ['audio1.mp3', 'audio2.mp3', 'audio3.mp3'];
    let index = 0;
    
    navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('previoustrack', function() {
      // User clicked "Previous Track" media notification icon.
      index = (index - 1 + playlist.length) % playlist.length;
      playAudio();
    });
    
    navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('nexttrack', function() {
      // User clicked "Next Track" media notification icon.
      index = (index + 1) % playlist.length;
      playAudio();
    });

    function playAudio() {
      audio.src = playlist[index];
      audio.play()
      .then(_ => { /* Set up Media Session... */ })
      .catch(error => { console.log(error); });
    }

    playButton.addEventListener('pointerup', function(event) {
      playAudio();
    });

The Media Session API allows you as well to show "Seek Backward" and "Seek
Forward" media notification icons if you want to control the amount of time
skipped.

    let skipTime= 10; /* Time to skip in seconds */

    navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekbackward', function() {
      // User clicked "Seek Backward" media notification icon.
      audio.currentTime = Math.max(audio.currentTime - skipTime, 0);
    });
    
    navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekforward', function() {
      // User clicked "Seek Forward" media notification icon.
      audio.currentTime = Math.min(audio.currentTime + skipTime, audio.duration);
    });

Note: As the browser may consider the web app is not be playing when media
files are seeking or loading, you can override this behaviour by setting
`navigator.mediaSession.playbackState` to `"playing"` or `"paused"`.  This
comes handy when you want to make sure your web app UI state is synced with the
media notification controls.

The cool thing about the Media Session API is that the notification tray is not
the only place where media metadata and controls are visible. The media
notification is synced automagically to any paired wearable device. And it also
shows up on lock screens.

## Make it play nice offline

I know what you're thinking now... *[Service Worker] to the rescue!*

True but first and foremost, you want to make sure **all items in this
checklist are checked**:

1. All media and artwork files are served with the appropriate `Cache-Control`
HTTP header. This will allow the browser to cache and reuse previously fetched
resources. See the [Caching checklist].
2. Make sure all media and artwork files are served with the
`Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` HTTP header. This will allow third-party web
apps to fetch and consume HTTP responses from your web server.

### The Service Worker caching strategy

Regarding media files, I would recommend a simple "[Cache, falling back to
network]" strategy as illustrated by Jake Archibald.

For artworks though, I'd be a little bit more specific and choose the approach
below:

- `If` artwork is already in cache, serve it from the cache
- `Else` fetch artwork from network
    - `If` fetch is successful, add network artwork to the cache and serve it
    - `Else` serve fallback artwork from the cache

That way, media notifications would always have a nice artwork icon even when
browser can't fetch it. Here's how you could implement this for instance:

    const FALLBACK_ARTWORK_URL = 'fallbackArtwork.png';
    
    self.addEventListener('install', event => {
      self.skipWaiting();
      event.waitUntil(initArtworksCache());
    });
    
    function initArtworksCache() {
      caches.open('artworks-cache-v1')
      .then(cache => cache.add(FALLBACK_ARTWORK_URL));
    }
    
    self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
      if (/artwork-[0-9]+\.png$/.test(event.request.url)) {
        event.respondWith(handleFetchArtwork(event.request));
      }
    });
    
    function handleFetchArtwork(request) {
      // Return cache request if it's in the cache already, otherwise fetch
      // network artwork.
      return getCacheArtwork(request)
      .then(cacheResponse => cacheResponse || getNetworkArtwork(request));
    }
    
    function getCacheArtwork(request) {
      return caches.open('artworks-cache-v1')
      .then(cache => cache.match(request));
    }
    
    function getNetworkArtwork(request) {
       // Fetch network artwork.
       return fetch(request)
       .then(networkResponse => {
         if (networkResponse.status !== 200) {
           return Promise.reject('Network artwork response is not valid');
         }
         // Add artwork to the cache for later use and return network response.
         addArtworkToCache(request, networkResponse.clone())
         return networkResponse;
       })
       .catch(error => {
         // Return cached fallback artwork.
         return getCacheArtwork(new Request(FALLBACK_ARTWORK_URL))
       });
    }
    
    function addArtworkToCache(request, response) {
      return caches.open('artworks-cache-v1')
      .then(cache => cache.put(request, response));
    }

Caution: If you want your service worker to be able to intercept artwork
network requests on [the very first page load], you may want to call
`clients.claim()` within your service worker once it's activated.

### Let user control cache

As user will consume content from your web app, media files and artworks may
take a lot of space on user's device. It is **your responsibility to show how
much cache is used and give user the ability to clear it**. Thankfully for us,
doing so is pretty easy with the [Cache API].

    // Here's how I'd compute how much cache is used by artworks... 
    caches.open('artworks-cache-v1')
    .then(cache => cache.matchAll())
    .then(responses => Promise.all(responses.map(r => r.blob())))
    .then(blobs => blobs.map(blob => blob.size).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0))
    .then(cacheSize => { console.log('Artworks cache is ' + cacheSize + ' bytes.'); })
    .catch(error => { console.log(error); });

    // And here's how to delete some artworks...
    const artworksToDelete = ['artwork1.png', 'artwork2.png', 'artwork3.png'];

    caches.open('artworks-cache-v1')
    .then(cache => Promise.all(artworksToDelete.map(artwork => cache.delete(artwork))))
    .catch(error => { console.log(error); });

## Implementation nits

- Chrome Media notifications show only if media files duration is [at least 5 seconds].
- Muted media files won't trigger Chrome media notifications.
- Media notifications use the favicon if no artworks are defined.
- Notification artwork size in Chrome for Android is `512x512`. For
  [low-end devices], it is `256x256`.
- Dismiss media notifications with `audio.src = ''`.
- Hook up an `<audio>` element as the input source to the [Web Audio API] makes
  it work with the Media Session API.

## Support

At the time of writing, Chrome for Android is the only platform that supports
the Media Session API. More up-to-date information on browser implementation
status can be found on [chromestatus.com].
