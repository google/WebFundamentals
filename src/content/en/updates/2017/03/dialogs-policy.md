# Chromium policy on JavaScript dialogs {: .page-title }

## History of JavaScript dialogs

JavaScript was introduced in 1995, and in the very first version of JavaScript
were methods on the window object named
[`alert()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert),
[`confirm()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm),
and [`prompt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt).

While they fit into the JavaScript of the time, their synchronous API is
problematic for modern browsers. Because the JavaScript engine needs to pause
until a user response is obtained, the JavaScript dialogs are app-modal. And
because the dialogs are app-modal, they commonly (and unfortunately) are used to
[harm](https://twitter.com/fugueish/status/702684718303588352)

[users](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2013/12/android-pop-ups-warn-of-infection/).

Because of this, the Chromium team highly recommends that you not use JavaScript dialogs.

## Alternatives

There are many options for dialog replacement.

There are several choices for `alert()/confirm()/prompt()`. For notifying the
user of events (e.g. calendaring sites), the
[Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API)
should be used. For obtaining user input, the
[HTML &lt;dialog&gt; element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)
should be used. For XSS proofs-of-concept, devtool’s
`console.log(document.origin)` can be used.

As for `onbeforeunload`, it should be noted that it is _already_ unreliable. As
Ilya Grigorik [points out](https://www.igvita.com/2015/11/20/dont-lose-user-and-app-state-use-page-visibility/),
“You _cannot rely_ on `pagehide`, `beforeunload`, and `unload` events to fire on
mobile platforms.” If you need to save state, you should use the
[Page Visibility API](https://w3c.github.io/page-visibility/#introduction).

## Changes

The ability for a page to specify the `onbeforeunload` string was
[removed in Chrome 51](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5349061406228480).
(It was also removed by Safari starting with Safari 9.1 and in Firefox 4.)

`alert()/confirm()/prompt()` dialogs are being changed. Rather than being app-modal,
they [will be dismissed when their tab is switched from](https://crbug.com/629964).
(Safari 9.1 already does this.) This is fully enabled on the canary and dev channels
and partially enabled on the beta and stable channels, and will be enabled more in the
future.

The current plan for `beforeunload` dialogs is to require a user gesture
to allow them to show. (This would not change the dispatching of the `beforeunload`
event.) This aligns Chromium with Firefox, which made this change with
[Firefox 44](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=636905).

Because of these changes, if your site uses dialogs, it is highly recommended
that you move to using the earlier-mentioned alternatives so that this will not
affect you.
