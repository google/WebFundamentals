# CSS deep-dive: matrix3d() for a frame-perfect custom scrollbar {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/surma.html" %}

Custom scrollbars are extremely rare and that’s mostly due to the fact that
scrollbars are one of the remaining bits on the web that are pretty much
unstylable (I’m looking at you, date picker).
You can use JavaScript to build your own, but that’s expensive, low
fidelity and can feel laggy. In this article we will leverage some
unconventional CSS matrices to build a custom scroller that doesn’t require any
JavaScript while scrolling, just some setup code.

### TL;DR: {: .hide-from-toc }
You don’t care about the nitty gritty? You just want to look at the
[Nyan cat demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/)
and get the library? You can find the demo’s code in our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ui-element-samples/tree/gh-pages/custom-scrollbar).

### LAM;WRA (Long and mathematical; will read anyways): {: .hide-from-toc }
Note: This article does some weird stuff with homogeneous coordinates as well as
matrix calculations. It is good to have some basic understanding of these
concepts if you want to understand the intricate details of this trick. However,
we hope that – even if you don’t enjoy matrix math – you can still
follow along and see how we used them.

A while ago we built a parallax scroller (Did you read
[that article](/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing)?
It’s really good, well worth your time!). By pushing elements back using CSS 3D
transforms, elements moved _slower_ than our actual scrolling speed.

## Recap
Let’s start off with a recap of how the parallax scroller worked.

    type="video/mp4; codecs=h264">
</video>

As shown in the animation, we achieved the parallax effect by pushing elements
“backwards” in 3D space, along the Z axis. Scrolling a document is effectively a
translation along the Y axis. So if we scroll _down_ by, say 100px, every
element will be translated _upwards_ by 100px. That applies to _all_ elements,
even the ones that are “further back”. But _because_ they are farther away from
the camera their _observed_ on-screen movement will be less than 100px, yielding
the desired parallax effect.

Of course, moving an element back in space will also make it appear smaller,
which we correct by scaling the element back up. We figured out the exact math
when we built the
[parallax scroller](/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing),
so I won’t repeat all the details.

## Step 0: What do we wanna do?
Scrollbars. That’s what we are going to build. But have you ever really thought
about what they do? I certainly didn’t. Scrollbars are an indicator of
_how much_ of the available content is currently visible and _how much progress_
you as the reader have made. If you scroll down, so does the scrollbar to
indicate that you are making progress towards the end. If all the content fits
into the viewport the scrollbar is usually hidden.
If the content has 2x the height of the viewport, the
scrollbar fills ½ of the height of the viewport. Content worth 3x the height of
the viewport scales the scrollbar to ⅓ of the viewport etc. You see the pattern.
Instead of scrolling you can also click-and-drag the scrollbar to move through
the site faster. That’s a surprising amount of behavior for an inconspicuous
element like that. Let’s fight one battle at a time.

## Step 1: Putting it in reverse
Okay, we can make elements move slower than the scrolling speed with CSS 3D
transforms as outlined in the parallax scrolling article. Can we also reverse
the direction? It turns out we can and that’s our way in for building a
frame-perfect, custom scrollbar. To understand how this works we need to cover a
few CSS 3D basics first.

To get any kind of perspective projection in the mathematical sense, you’ll most
likely end up using
[homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates).
I’m not going into detail what they are and why they work, but you can think of
them like 3D coordinates with an additional, fourth coordinate called _w_. This
coordinate should be 1 except if you want to have perspective distortion. We
don’t need to worry about the detials of _w_ as we are not going to use any
other value than 1. Therefore all points are from now on 4-dimensional vectors
[x, y, z, w=1] and consequently matrices need
to be 4x4 as well.

One occasion where you can see that CSS uses homogeneous coordinates under the
hood is when you define your own 4x4 matrices in a transform property using the
`matrix3d()` function. `matrix3d` takes 16 arguments (because the matrix is
4x4), specifying one column after the other. So we can use this function to
manually specify rotations, translations etc.. But what it also allows us to do
is mess around with that _w_ coordinate!

Before we can make use of `matrix3d()`, we need a 3D context – because without a
3D context there wouldn’t be any perspective distortion and no need for
homogeneous coordinates. To create a 3D context we need a container with a
`perspective` and some elements inside that we can transform in the newly
created 3D space. For
[example](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/step-1.html):

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/03/custom-scrollbar/perspective.png"
  alt="A piece of CSS code that distorts a div using CSS’
    perspective attribute.">

The elements inside a perspective container are processed by the CSS engine
as follows:

* Turn each corner (vertex) of an element into homogenous coordinates
  `[x,y,z,w]`, relative to the perspective container.
* Apply all of the element’s transforms as matrices from _right to left_.
* If the perspective element is scrollable, apply a scroll matrix.
* Apply the perspective matrix.

The scroll matrix is a translation along the y axis. If we _scroll down_ by
400px, all elements need to be _moved up_ by 400px. The perspective matrix is a
matrix that “pulls” points closer to the vanishing point the further back in 3D
space they are. This achieves both effects of making things appear smaller when
they are farther back and also makes them “move slower” when being translated.
So if an element is pushed back, a translation of 400px will cause the element
to only move 300px on the screen.

If you want to know _all_ the details, you should read the
[spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms-2/#transform-rendering) on CSS’
transform rendering model, but for the sake of this article I simplified the
algorithm above.

Our box is inside a perspective container with value p for the `perspective`
attribute, and let’s assume the container is scrollable and is scrolled down by
n pixels.

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/03/custom-scrollbar/matrixmath01.svg"
  alt="Perspective matrix times scroll matrix times element transform matrix
  equals four by four identity matrix with minus one over p in the fourth row
  third column times four by four identity matrix with minus n in the second
  row fourth column times element transform matrix.">

The first matrix is the perspective matrix, the second matrix is the scroll
matrix. To recap: The scroll matrix’ job is to make an element _move up_ when we
are _scrolling down_, hence the negative sign.

For our scrollbar however we want the _opposite_ – we want our element to
_move down_ when we are scrolling _down_. Here’s where we can use a trick:
Inverting the _w_ coordinate of the corners of our box. If the _w_ coordinate is
-1, all translations will take effect in the opposite direction. So how do we do
that? The CSS engine takes care of converting the corners of our box to
homogeneous coordinates, and sets w to 1. It’s time for `matrix3d()` to shine!

    .box {
      transform:
        matrix3d(
          1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 1, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 1, 0,
          0, 0, 0, -1
        );
    }

This matrix will do nothing else then negating _w_. So when the CSS engine has
turned each corner into a vector of the form `[x,y,z,1]`, the matrix will
convert it into `[x,y,z,-1]`.

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/03/custom-scrollbar/matrixmath02.svg"
  alt="Four by four identity matrix with minus one over p in the fourth row
  third column times four by four identity matrix with minus n in the second
  row fourth column times four by four identity matrix with minus one in the
  fourth row fourth column times four dimensional vector x, y, z, 1 equals four
  by four identity matrix with minus one over p in the fourth row third column,
  minus n in the second row fourth column and minus one in the fourth row
  fourth column equals four dimensional vector x, y plus n, z, minus z over
  p minus 1.">

I listed an intermediate step to show the effect of our element transform
matrix. If you are not comfortable with matrix math, that is okay. The Eureka
moment is that in the last line we end up adding the scroll offset n to our y
coordinate instead of subtracting it. The element will be translated _downwards_
if we scroll _down_.

However, if we just put this matrix in our
[example](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/step-2.html),
the element will not be displayed. This is because the CSS spec requires that any
vertex with _w_ < 0 blocks the element from being rendered. And since our z
coordinate is currently 0, and p is 1, _w_ will be -1.

Luckily, we can choose the value of z! To make sure we end up with w=1, we need
to set z = -2.

    .box {
      transform:
        matrix3d(
          1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 1, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 1, 0,
          0, 0, 0, -1
        )
        translateZ(-2px);
    }

Lo and behold, our
[box is back](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/step-3.html)!

## Step 2: Make it move
Now our box is there and is looking the same way it would have without any
transforms. Right now the perspective container is not scrollable, so we can’t
see it, but _we know_ that our element will go the _other direction_ when
scrolled. So let’s make the container scroll, shall we? We can just add a
spacer element that takes up space:

    <div class="container">
      <div class="box"></div>
      <span class="spacer"></span>
    </div>

    <style>
    /* … all the styles from the previous example … */
    .container {
      overflow: scroll;
    }
    .spacer {
      display: block;
      height: 500px;
    }
    </style>

And now
[scroll the box](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/step-4.html)!
The red box moves down.

## Step 3: Give it a size
We have an element that moves down when the page scrolls down. That’s the hard
bit out of the way, really. Now we need to style it to look like a scrollbar and
make it a bit more interactive.

A scrollbar usually consists of a “thumb” and a “track”, while the track isn’t
always visible. The thumb’s height is directly proportional to how much of the
content is visible.

    <script>
      const scroller = document.querySelector('.container');
      const thumb = document.querySelector('.box');
      const scrollerHeight = scroller.getBoundingClientRect().height;
      thumb.style.height = /* ??? */;
    </script>

`scrollerHeight` is the height of the scrollable element, while
`scroller.scrollHeight` is the total height of the scrollable content.
`scrollerHeight/scroller.scrollHeight` is the fraction of the content that is
visible. The ratio of vertical space the thumb covers should be equal to the
ratio of content that is visible:

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/03/custom-scrollbar/thumbmath01.svg"
  alt="thumb dot style dot height over scrollerHeight equals scroller height
  over scroller dot scroll height if and only if thumb dot style dot height
  equals scroller height times scroller height over scroller dot scroll
  height.">

    <script>
      // …
      thumb.style.height =
        scrollerHeight * scrollerHeight / scroller.scrollHeight + 'px';
      // Accommodate for native scrollbars
      thumb.style.right =
        (scroller.clientWidth - scroller.getBoundingClientRect().width) + 'px';
    </script>

Note: We need to adjust `right` so our custom scrollbar is visible on systems
with permanent native scrollbars. We will completely hide the native scrollbars
later with a trick.

The size of the thumb is
[looking good](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/step-5.html),
but it’s moving way too fast. This is where we can grab our technique from the
parallax scroller. If we move the element further back it will move slower while
scrolling. We can correct the size by scaling it up. But how much should we push
it back exactly? Let’s do some – you guessed it – math! This is the last time, I
promise.

The crucial bit of information is that we want the bottom edge of the thumb to
line up with the bottom edge of the scrollable element when scrolled all the way
down. In other words: If we have scrolled
`scroller.scrollHeight - scroller.height` pixels, we want our thumb to be
translated by `scroller.height - thumb.height`. For every pixel of scroller, we
want our thumb to move a fraction of a pixel:

<img src="/web/updates/images/2017/03/custom-scrollbar/thumbmath02.svg"
  alt="factor equals scroller dot height minus thumb dot height over scroller
  dot scroll height minus scroller dot height.">

That’s our scaling factor. Now we need to convert the scaling factor into a
translation along the z axis, which we already did in the parallax scrolling
article. According to the
[relevant section in the spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms-2/#perspective):
The scaling factor is equal to p/(p − z). We can solve this equation for z to
figure out how much we we need to translate our thumb along the z axis. But keep
in mind that due to our w coordinate shenanigans we need to translate an
additional `-2px` along z. Also note that an element’s transforms are applied
right to left, meaning that all translations before our special matrix will not
be inverted, all translations after our special matrix, however, will! Let’s
codify this!

    <script>
      // ... code from above...
      const factor =
        (scrollerHeight - thumbHeight)/(scroller.scrollHeight - scrollerHeight);
      thumb.style.transform = `
        matrix3d(
          1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 1, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 1, 0,
          0, 0, 0, -1
        )
        scale(${1/factor})
        translateZ(${1 - 1/factor}px)
        translateZ(-2px)
      `;
    </script>

We have a
[scrollbar](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/step-6.html)!
And it’s just a DOM element that we can style however we like. One thing that is
important to do in terms of accessibility is to make the thumb respond to
click-and-drag, as many users are used to interacting with a scrollbar that way.
For the sake of not making this blog post even longer, I am not going explain
the details for that part. Take a look at the
[library code](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ui-element-samples/blob/gh-pages/custom-scrollbar/scrollbar.js#L5-L25)
for details if you want to see how it’s done.

## What about iOS?
Ah, my old friend iOS Safari. As with the parallax scrolling, we run into an
issue here. Because we are scrolling on an element, we need to specify
`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`, but that causes 3D flattening and our entire
scrolling effect stops working. We solved this problem in the parallax scroller
by detecting iOS Safari and relying on `position: sticky` as a workaround, and
we’ll do exactly the same thing here. Take a look at the
[parallaxing article](/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing)
to refresh your memory.

## What about the browser scrollbar?
On some systems we will have to deal with a permanent, native scrollbar.
Historically, the scrollbar can’t be hidden (except with a
[non-standard pseudo-selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar)).
So to hide it we have to resort to some (math-free) hackery. We wrap our
scrolling element in a container with `overflow-x: hidden` and make the
scrolling element wider than the container. The browser’s native scrollbar is
now out of view.

## Fin
Putting it all together, we can now build a frame-perfect custom
scrollbar – like the one in our
[Nyan cat demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/ui-element-samples/custom-scrollbar/).

If you can’t see Nyan cat, you are experiencing
[a bug that we found and filed](https://crbug.com/699140)
while building this demo (click the thumb to make Nyan cat appear).
Chrome is really good at avoiding unnecessary work
like painting or animating things that are off-screen. The bad news is that our
matrix shenanigans make Chrome think the Nyan cat gif is actually off-screen.
Hopefully this will get fixed soon.

There you have it. That was a lot of work. I applaud you for reading the entire
thing. This is some
real trickery to get this working and it’s probably rarely worth the effort,
except when a customized scrollbar is an essential part of the experience. But
good to know that it is possible, no? The fact that it is this hard to do a
custom scrollbar shows that there’s work to be done on CSS’s side. But fear not!
In the future,
[Houdini](/web/updates/2016/05/houdini)’s
[AnimationWorklet](https://dassur.ma/things/animworklet/) is going to make
frame-perfect scroll-linked effects like this a lot easier.
