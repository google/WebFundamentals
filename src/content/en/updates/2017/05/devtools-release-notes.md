## New features {: #features }

### New Audits panel, powered by Lighthouse {: #lighthouse }

The Audits panel is now powered by [Lighthouse][LH]. Lighthouse provides a
comprehensive set of tests for measuring the quality of your web pages.

[LH]: /web/tools/lighthouse

The scores at the top for [**Progressive Web App**][PWA], [**Performance**][Perf],
[**Accessibility**][a11y], and [**Best Practices**][BP] are your aggregate scores for each
of those categories. The rest of the report is a breakdown of each of the
tests that determined your scores. Improve the quality of your web page by
fixing the failing tests.

[PWA]: /web/progressive-web-apps/
[Perf]: /web/fundamentals/performance/
[a11y]: /web/fundamentals/accessibility/
[BP]: /web/fundamentals/

To audit a page:

1. Click the **Audits** tab.
1. Click **Perform an audit**.
1. Click **Run audit**. Lighthouse sets up DevTools to emulate a mobile
   device, runs a bunch of tests against the page, and then displays the
   results in the **Audits** panel.

### Third-party badges {: #badges }

Use third-party badges to get more insight into the entities that are
making network requests on a page, logging to the Console, and executing
JavaScript.

</figure>

To enable third-party badges:

1. Open the [Command Menu][CM].
1. Run the `Show third party badges` command.

Use the **Group by product** option in the **Call Tree** and
**Bottom-Up** tabs to group performance recording activity by the third-party
entities that caused the activities. See [Get Started With Analyzing Runtime
Performance][GSRP] to learn how to analyze performance with DevTools.

};

{% endframebox %}

### A new gesture for Continue to Here {: #continue }

Say you're paused on line 25 of a script, and you want to jump to line 50. In
the past, you could set a breakpoint on line 50, or right-click the line and
select **Continue to here**. But now, there's a faster gesture for handling
this workflow.

When stepping through code, hold <kbd>Command</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Control</kbd>
(Windows, Linux) and then click to continue to that line of code. DevTools
highlights the jumpable destinations in blue.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/05/continue.gif"
       alt="Continue to Here"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 5</b>. Continue To Here
  </figcaption>

See [Get Started With Debugging JavaScript][GSDJ] to learn the basics of
debugging in DevTools.

[GSDJ]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/

{% framebox width="auto" height="auto" enable_widgets="true" %}
<script>
var label = 'WNDT60 / Continue To Here / Sentiment';
{% include "web/updates/2017/05/_sentiment.js" %}
</script>
{% include "web/_shared/multichoice.html" %}
{% endframebox %}

### Step into async {: #step-into-async }

A big theme for the DevTools team in the near future is to make debugging
asynchronous code predictable, and to provide you a complete history of
asynchronous execution.

The [new gesture for Continue to Here](#continue) also works with asynchronous
code. When you hold <kbd>Command</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Control</kbd> (Windows,
Linux), DevTools highlights jumpable asynchronous destinations in green.

Check out the demo below from the DevTools talk at I/O for an example.

Note: The video should start playing at 17:40, which is when Paul discusses
the feature.

## Changes {: #changes }

### More informative object previews in the Console {: #object-previews }

Previously, when you logged or evaluated an object in the Console, the Console
would only display `Object`, which is not particularly helpful.
Now, the Console provides more information about the contents of the object.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/05/oldobjpreview.png"
       alt="How the Console used to preview objects"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 6</b>. How the Console used to preview objects

       alt="How the Console now previews objects"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 7</b>. How the Console now previews objects

</figure>

<script>
var label = 'WNDT60 / New Object Previews UI / Sentiment';
{% include "web/updates/2017/05/_sentiment.js" %}
</script>
{% include "web/_shared/multichoice.html" %}
{% endframebox %}

### More informative context selection menu in the Console {: #context }

The Console's Context Selection menu now provides more information about
available contexts.

* The title describes what each item is.
* The subtitle below the title describes the domain where the item came from.
* Hover over an iframe context to highlight it in the viewport.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/05/context.png"
       alt="The new Context Selection menu"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 8</b>. Hovering over an iframe in the new Context Selection
    menu highlights it in the viewport

{% framebox width="auto" height="auto" enable_widgets="true" %}
<script>
var label = 'WNDT60 / New Context Selection Menu UI / Sentiment';
{% include "web/updates/2017/05/_sentiment.js" %}
</script>
{% include "web/_shared/multichoice.html" %}
{% endframebox %}

### Real-time updates in the Coverage tab {: #coverage }

When recording code coverage in Chrome 59, the **Coverage** tab would just
display "Recording...", with no visibility into what code was being used.
Now, the **Coverage** tab shows you in real-time what code is being used.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/05/oldcoverage.gif"
       alt="Loading and interacting with a page using the old Coverage tab"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 9</b>. Loading and interacting with a page using the old
    <b>Coverage</b> tab

  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 10</b>. Loading and interacting with a page using the new
    <b>Coverage</b> tab

</figure>

{% framebox width="auto" height="auto" enable_widgets="true" %}
<script>
var label = 'WNDT60 / Real-Time Coverage Tab Updates / Sentiment';
{% include "web/updates/2017/05/_sentiment.js" %}
</script>
{% include "web/_shared/multichoice.html" %}
{% endframebox %}

### Simpler network throttling options {: #network-throttling }

The network throttling menus in the **Network** and **Performance** panels
have been simplified to include only three options: **Offline**, **Slow 3G**,
which is common in places like India, and **Fast 3G**, which is common in
places like the United States.

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2017/05/throttling.png"
       alt="The new network throttling options"/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 11</b>. The new network throttling options
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The throttling options have been tweaked to match other, kernel-level
throttling tools. DevTools no longer shows the latency, download, and upload
metrics next to each option, because those values were misleading. The goal
is to match the true experience of each option.

{% framebox width="auto" height="auto" enable_widgets="true" %}
<script>
var label = 'WNDT60 / Simplified Network Throttling / Sentiment';
{% include "web/updates/2017/05/_sentiment.js" %}
</script>
{% include "web/_shared/multichoice.html" %}
{% endframebox %}

### Async stacks on by default {: #async-stacks }

The **Async** checkbox has been removed from the **Sources** panel. Async
stack traces are now on by default. In the past, this option was opt-in,
because of performance overhead. The overhead is now minimal enough to enable
the feature by default. If you prefer to have async stack traces disabled,
you can turn them off in [Settings][Settings] or by running the `Do not
capture async stack traces` command in the [Command Menu][CM].

[Settings]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/ui#settings
[CM]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/ui#command-menu

{% framebox width="auto" height="auto" enable_widgets="true" %}
<script>
var label = 'WNDT60 / Async Stacks On By Default / Sentiment';
{% include "web/updates/2017/05/_sentiment.js" %}
</script>
{% include "web/_shared/multichoice.html" %}
{% endframebox %}
