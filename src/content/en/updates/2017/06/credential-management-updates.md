## Chrome 57

Chrome 57 introduced this important change to the
[Credential Management API](/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management).

### Credentials can be shared from a different subdomain 

Chrome can now retrieve a credential stored in a different subdomain using the
[Credential Management API](/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management).
For example, if a password is stored in `login.example.com`,
a script on `www.example.com` can show it as one of account items in account chooser dialog.

You must explicitly store the password using `navigator.credentials.store()`,
so that when a user chooses a credential by tapping on the dialog,
the password gets passed and copied to the current origin.

Once it's stored, the password is available as a credential
in the exact same origin `www.example.com` onward.

In the following screenshot, credential information stored under `login.aliexpress.com`
is visible to `m.aliexpress.com` and available for the user to choose from:

<aside class="note">
  <strong>Coming soon:</strong>
  Sharing credentials between totally different domains is in development.

## Chrome 60

Chrome 60 introduces several important changes to the
[Credential Management API](/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management):

* [`PasswordCredential` object now includes a password.](#password)

*  As the custom `fetch()` function is no longer required to fetch the password,
[it will be deprecated soon](#fetchdeprecation).

* [`navigator.credentials.get()` now accepts an enum `mediation`](#mediation)
instead of boolean flag `unmediated`.

* [`requireUserMediation()` renamed to `preventSilentAccess()`](#preventsilentaccess).

* [New method `navigator.credentials.create()`](#credentialscreate)
asynchronously creates credential objects.


### Feature detection needs attention

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
Because updates to the Credential Management API landed on Chrome 60 contains
backward incompatible changes, it's important that your implementation won't be
triggered on older versions. (If you intentionally want to do so, checkout
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/154cO-0d5paDFfhN79GNdet1VeMUmELKhNv3YHvVSOh8/edit">this
migration guide doc.</a>
</aside>

To check if the new Credential Management API is available, check if
`preventSilentAccess` exists.

```js
if (navigator.credentials && navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess) {
  // The new Credential Management API is available
}
```

### `PasswordCredential` object now includes password {: #password}

The Credential Management API took a conservative approach to handling passwords.
It concealed passwords from JavaScript, requiring developers
to send the `PasswordCredential` object directly to their server
for validation via an extension to the `fetch()` API.

But this approach introduced a number of restrictions.
We received feedback that developers could not use the API because:

* They had to send the password as part of a JSON object.

* They had to send the hash value of the password to their server.

After performing a security analysis and recognizing that concealing passwords
from JavaScript did not prevent all attack vectors as effectively as we were hoping,
we have decided to make a change.

The Credential Management API now includes a raw password
in a returned credential object so you have access to it as plain text.
You can use existing methods to deliver credential information to your server:

    navigator.credentials.get({
      password: true,
      federated: {
        providers: [ 'https://accounts.google.com' ]
      },
      mediation: 'silent'
    }).then(passwordCred => {
      if (passwordCred) {
        let form = new FormData();
        form.append('email', passwordCred.id);
        form.append('password', passwordCred.password);
        form.append('csrf_token', csrf_token);
        return fetch('/signin', {
          method: 'POST',
          credentials: 'include',
          body: form
        });
      } else {
        
        // Fallback to sign-in form
      }
    }).then(res => {
      if (res.status === 200) {
        return res.json();
      } else {
        throw 'Auth failed';
      }
    }).then(profile => {
      console.log('Auth succeeded', profile);
    });

### Custom fetch will be deprecated soon {: #fetchdeprecation}

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  Now that passwords are no longer returned in the <code>PasswordCredential</code> object,
  the custom <code>fetch()</code> function will stop working in Chrome 62.
  Developers <strong>must</strong> update their code.
</aside>

To determine if you are using a custom `fetch()` function,
check if it uses a `PasswordCredential` object or a `FederatedCredential` object
as a value of `credentials` property, for example:

    fetch('/signin', {
      method: 'POST',
      credentials: c
    })

Using a regular `fetch()` function as shown in the previous code example,
or using an `XMLHttpRequest` is recommended.

### `navigator.credentials.get()` now accepts an enum mediation {: #mediation}

Until Chrome 60,
`navigator.credentials.get()` accepted an optional `unmediated` property
with a boolean flag. For example:

    navigator.credentials.get({
      password: true,
      federated: {
        providers: [ 'https://accounts.google.com' ]
      },
      unmediated: true
    }).then(c => {

      // Sign-in
    });

Setting `unmediated: true` prevents the browser from showing the account chooser
when passing a credential.

The flag is now extended as mediation.
The user mediation could happen when:

* A user needs to choose an account to sign-in with.

* A user wants to explicitly sign-in
after `navigator.credentials.requireUseMediation()` call.

Choose one of the following options for the `mediation` value:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><code>mediation</code> value</th>
    <th>Compared to boolean flag</th>
    <th>Behavior</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>silent</code></td>
    <td>Equals <code>unmediated: true</code></td>
    <td>Credential passed without showing an account chooser.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>optional</code></td>
    <td>Equals <code>unmediated: false</code></td>
    <td>Shows an account chooser if
    <code>preventSilentAccess()</code> called previously.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>required</code></td>
    <td>A new option</td>
    <td>Always show an account chooser.
    Useful when you want to let a user to switch an account
    using the native account chooser dialog.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this example,
the credential is passed without showing an account chooser,
the equivalent of the previous flag, `unmediated: true`:

    navigator.credentials.get({
      password: true,
      federated: {
        providers: [ 'https://accounts.google.com' ]
      },
      mediation: 'silent'
    }).then(c => {

      // Sign-in
    });

### `requireUserMediation()` renamed to `preventSilentAccess()` {: #preventsilentaccess}

To align nicely with the new `mediation` property offered in the `get()` call,
the `navigator.credentials.requireUserMediation()` method has been renamed to
`navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess()`.

The renamed method prevents passing a credential without showing the account chooser
(sometimes called without user mediation).
This is useful when a user signs out of a website or unregisters
from one and doesn't want to get signed back in automatically at the next visit.

    signoutUser();
    if (navigator.credentials) {
      navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess();
    }

### Create credential objects asynchronously with new method `navigator.credentials.create()` {: #credentialscreate}

You now have the option to create credential objects asynchronously
with the new method, `navigator.credentials.create()`.
Read on for a comparison between both the sync and async approaches.

#### Creating a `PasswordCredential` object

##### Sync approach

    let c = new PasswordCredential(form);

##### Async approach (new)

    let c = await navigator.credentials.create({
      password: form
    });

or:

    let c = await navigator.credentials.create({
      password: {
        id: id,
        password: password
      }
    });

#### Creating a `FederatedCredential` object

##### Sync approach

    let c = new FederatedCredential({
      id:       'agektmr',
      name:     'Eiji Kitamura',
      provider: 'https://accounts.google.com',
      iconURL:  'https://*****'
    });

##### Async approach (new)

    let c = await navigator.credentials.create({
      federated: {
        id:       'agektmr',
        name:     'Eiji Kitamura',
        provider: 'https://accounts.google.com',
        iconURL:  'https://*****'
      }
    });
