# Introduction to the Budget API {: .page-title }

The Push Messaging API enables us to send notifications to a user even when the
browser is closed. Many developers want to be able to use this messaging to
update and synchornise content without the browser being open, but the API has
one important restriction: you must always display a notification for every
single push message recieved.

Being able to send a push message to synchronize data on a user's device can be
extremely useful for users and developers, but allowing a web app to do work in
the background without the user knowing is open to abuse.

The [Budget
](https://wicg.github.io/budget-api/)[API](https://wicg.github.io/budget-api/),
is a new API designed to allow developers to perform background work without
notifying the user, such as silent push or performing a background fetch. In
Chrome 60 and above you'll be able to start using this API and the
Chrome team is eager to get feedback from developers.

To allow developers to consume a user's resources in the background, the web
platform is introducing the concept of a budget using the new Budget API. Each
site has a set amount of resource that they can consume for background actions,
such as a silent push, where each operation will depleat the budget. When the
budget is spent, background actions can no longer be performed without user
visibility or consent. The user agent will be responsible for determining budget
assigned to a web app based on it's heuristics, for example budget allowance
could be linked to user engagement. Each browser can decide it's own heuristic.

**TL;DR **The budget API allows to you to reserve budget, use budget, get a list
of remaining budget and understand the cost of background operations

## Reserving Budget

In Chrome 60 and above, the `navigator.budget.reserve()` method will be available
without any flags.

The `reserve()` method allows you to request budget for a specific operation and
it'll return a boolean to indicate if the budget can be reserved. If
the budget was reserved, there is no need to notify the user of your background
work.

In the example of push notifications, you can attempt to reserve budget for a
"silent-push" operation and if `reserve()` resolves with true, the operation is allowed.
Otherwise it'll return false and you'll need to show a notification

```javascript
self.addEventListener('push', event => {
 const promiseChain = navigator.budget.reserve('silent-push')
   .then((reserved) => {
     if (reserved) {
       // No need to show a notification.
       return;
     }

     // Not enough budget is available, must show a notification.
     return registration.showNotification(...);
   });
 event.waitUntil(promiseChain);
});
```

In Chrome 60, 'silent-push' is the only operation type that is
available, but you can find a [full list of operation types in the spec
](https://wicg.github.io/budget-api/#enumdef-operationtype). There is also no
way to reset your budget once it's used, the
only way to get more budget is to use a new profile. Sadly you can't use
incognito for this either as the Budget API will return a budget of zero in
Incognito (although there is a [bug that results in an
error](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=730079) during
my testing).

You should only call `reserve()` when you intend to perform the operation you are
reserving. If you called reserve in the above example but still showed a
notification, the budget will still be used.

One common use case that isn't enabled by `reserve()` alone, is the ability to
schedule a silent push from a backend. The Budget API does have API's to enable
this use case but they are still being worked on in Chrome and are currently
only available behind flags and / or an [Origin
Trial](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md).

## Budget API and Origin Trials

There are two methods, `getBudget()` and `getCost()`, that can be used by a web app
to plan the usage of their budget.

In Chrome 60, both of these methods are behind an [origin
trial](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md)
but you can use them locally by enabling the Experimental Web Platform features
flag (Open chrome://flags/\#enable-experimental-web-platform-features in
Chrome).

Let's look how to use these API's.

### Get your Budget

You can find your available budget with the `getBudget()` method. This returns
an array of BudgetStates which will indicate your budget at various points in
time.

To list the budget entries we can run:

```javascript
navigator.budget.getBudget()
.then((budgets) => {
  budgets.forEach((element) => {
    console.log(\`At '${new Date(element.time).toString()}' \` +
      \`your budget will be '${element.budgetAt}'.\`);
  });
});
```

The first entry will be your current budget and additional values will be future
changes to your budget.

```
At 'Mon Jun 05 2017 12:47:20' you will have a budget of '1'.
At 'Fri Jun 09 2017 10:42:57' you will have a budget of '2'.
At 'Fri Jun 09 2017 12:31:09' you will have a budget of '3'.
```

One of the benefits of including future budget allowances is that developers can
share this information with their backend to adapt their server side behavior
(i.e. only send a push message to trigger an update when the client has budget
for a silent push).

Note: At the time of writing there [is a
bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=730064#) where the
budget can decrease to a negative value. Your budget should never go below zero.

### Get the Cost of an Operation

To find out how much an operation will cost, calling `getCost()` will return a
number indicating the maximum amount of budget that will be consumed if you call
`reserve()` for that operation.

For example, we can find out the cost of not showing a notification when you
receive a push message (i.e. the cost of a silent push), with the following
code:

```javascript
navigator.budget.getCost('silent-push')
.then((cost) => {
  console.log('Cost of silent push is:', cost);
})
.catch((err) => {
  console.error('Unable to get cost:', err);
});
```

At the time of writing, Chrome 60 will print:

```
Cost of silent push is: 2
```

One thing to highlight with the `reserve()` and `getCost()` methods is that the
actual cost of an operation can **be less than** the cost returned by `getCost()`.
You may still be able to reserve an operation if your current budget is less
than the indicated cost. The specific details from the spec are as
[follows](https://wicg.github.io/budget-api/#concepts):

> The reserved cost of certain background operations could be less than the cost
> indicated by getCost() when the user's device is in favorable conditions, for
> example because it's not on battery power.

Note: If you pass in an operation type that the browser does not support or is
invalid, the promise will reject with a `TypeError`.

That's the current API in Chrome and as the web continues to support new API's
that require the ability to perform background work, like [background
fetch](https://wicg.github.io/background-fetch/), the Budget API can be used to
manage the number of operations you can perform without notifying the user.

As you use the API please provide feedback through the [Origin
Trial](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md)
or [crbug.com](https://crbug.com/).
