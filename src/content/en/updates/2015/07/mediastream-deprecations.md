If you work with `getUserMedia()` or WebRTC, you may need to adjust your code
for Chrome 45 and later.

The [MediaStream API](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/) represents
synchronized streams of media. For example, a stream taken from camera and
microphone input has synchronized video and audio tracks. Each track is
represented by a
[MediaStreamTrack](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#mediastreamtrack).
(Not to be confused with the [&lt;track&gt;
element](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/track/basics/){: .external }!)

There are three `MediaStream` deprecations in Chrome 45:

* `MediaStream.ended`
* `MediaStream.label`
* `MediaStream.stop()`

In parallel are two additions:

* `MediaStream.active`
* `MediaStreamTrack.stop()`

These require the following changes:

* Use `MediaStream.active` to check if a `MediaStream` is streaming, not `MediaStream.ended`.
* Use `MediaStreamTrack.stop()` to stop streaming, not `MediaStream.stop()`.
* If you need a unique identifier for a `MediaStream` use `MediaStream.id` instead of `MediaStream.label`. `MediaStreamTrack.label` provides a human-readable name for the source device for a stream, e.g. _FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in) (05ac:8510)_.

You can see these in action: open [simpl.info/gum](https://simpl.info/gum) in
Chrome (on a device with a camera) and view the Chrome DevTools console. The
MediaStream object `stream` passed to the `getUserMedia()` callback in this
demo is in global scope, so you can inspect it from the console.  Call
`stream.getTracks()[0]` to view the `MediaStreamTrack` for this stream.

## Stop(), ended and active

When the [Media Capture and Streams](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html) W3C Working Group looked at the problem of what happens when you add new tracks to a `MediaStream`,
and whether an empty `MediaStream` is ended, they realized that there was
no sensible way to implement `ended` on a `MediaStream` (as in 'will never start again'). In other parts of HTML5 'ended' means 'this has ended and will
never resume'. 'Active' carries no such implication: an inactive stream can
become active again, for instance if a new track is added to it. Rather than maintain a confusing attribute and function, the Working Group decided to
remove it.

Here's an example of how to use 'MediaStream.active' to check the status of a
stream:

    var gumStream;

    navigator.getUserMedia({audio: false, video: true},
        function(stream) {
             gumStream = stream;
            // ...
        },
        function(error) {
            console.log('getUserMedia() error', error);
        });

    // â€¦

    if (gumStream.active) {
        // do something with the stream
    }

Removing `stop()` from `MediaStream` did not remove any real functionality:
processes for detaching source devices and so on have to be done on
`MediaStreamTrack` anyway. Use `stop()` on `MediaStreamTrack` instead:

    navigator.getUserMedia({audio: false, video: true},
        function(stream) {
             // can also use getAudioTracks() or getVideoTracks()
            var track = stream.getTracks()[0];  // if only one media track
            // ...
            track.stop();
        },
        function(error){
            console.log('getUserMedia() error', error);
        });

## label

It turns out that nobody could quite figure out a use for this property!

`MediaStream.label` had been added to the first version of the spec, but nobody really knew
what `label` was for. It was also unclear what happened to `label` when a stream
was sent via `RTCPeerConnection`.

The W3C Working Group [asked around](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2015Apr/0025.html), and nobody wanted it, so they removed it.

To reiterate: `MediaStream.id` provides a unique identifier for a
`MediaStream` and `MediaStreamTrack.label` provides the name of the source
of a stream, such as the type of camera or microphone.

More information about `MediaStream` and `MediaStreamTrack` is available
from [Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream), and
HTML5 Rocks provides an excellent introduction to `getUserMedia()` in
[Capturing Audio &
Video](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/){: .external }.
