People hate filling out web forms, especially on mobile devices. They can be
slow and frustrating to complete and often contain multi-page steps and
validation issues. This leads to high user drop-off and frustration. To help
make things easier for users, browsers have long been able to autocomplete
fields on behalf of the user. Chrome took this a step further in 2011 by
introducing [Autofill](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893),
which fills in entire forms based on a user's Autofill profile.

Starting in the next major version of Chrome (M43), we're taking yet another
step to help users fill out forms faster by expanding our support for credit
cards and addresses in Google. This means that the same information users use to
purchase things inside of the Google Play store are now available to them on
websites. By using the standard _autocomplete_ attributes, you can ensure your
users' happiness by helping Chrome autofill your checkout forms with 100%
accuracy.

Autocomplete attributes are a way for you, the developer, to control how the
browser should populate a given form field.  For example, if you are expecting a
street address you can hint to the browser that you are expecting it by using
`autocomplete="address-line1"`. This prevents the browser from incorrectly
guessing form fields on your website which can result in a poor user experience.

We've found that by correctly using autocomplete attributes on your forms, users
complete them up to 30% faster. And since _autocomplete_ is part of the
[WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#autofill)
[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#autofill)
standard, we hope that other browsers will support it in the near future.  


In the past, many developers would add _autocomplete="off"_ to their form fields
to prevent the browser from performing any kind of autocomplete functionality.
While Chrome will still respect this tag for autocomplete data, it will not
respect it for autofill data. So when should you use _autocomplete="off"_? One
example is when you've implemented your own version of autocomplete for search.
Another example is any form field where users will input and submit different
kinds of information where it would not be useful to have the browser remember
what was submitted previously.

The most common _autocomplete_ attributes are shown in the table below and are
documented in [Web Fundamentals](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/input/forms/).

## Common Attributes

### Credit Card

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        name attribute
      </th>
      <th>
        autocomplete attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ccname<br>
        cardnumber  
        cvc  
        ccmonth  
        ccyear

<table>
<tr>
<th markdown="block">

</table>


    <label for="frmAddressS">Address</label>
    <input name="ship-address" required id="frmAddressS" placeholder="123 Any Street" autocomplete="shipping street-address">
    
    <label for="frmCityS">City</label>
    <input name="ship-city" required id="frmCityS" placeholder="New York" autocomplete="shipping locality">

    <input name="ship-zip" required id="frmZipS" placeholder="10011" autocomplete="shipping postal-code">
    
    <label for="frmCountryS">Country</label>
    <input name="ship-country" required id="frmCountryS" placeholder="USA" autocomplete="shipping country">
    


### Phone

<table>
<tr>
<th>
name attribute
</th>
<th>
autocomplete attribute
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">
phone  
mobile  
country-code  
area-code  
exchange  
suffix  
ext
</td>
<td markdown="block">
tel
</td>
</tr>
</table>


    <label for="frmPhoneNumA">Phone</label>
    <input type="tel" name="phone" id="frmPhoneNumA" placeholder="+1-650-450-1212" required autocomplete="tel">
    


The autocomplete attributes can be accompanied with a section name, such as:

* **shipping** - given-name
* **billing**  - street-address<br/>

It is recommended because it will make your markup easier to parse and
understand. The browser will autofill different sections separately and not as a
continuous form.

### An example of a payment form


    <label for="frmNameCC">Name on card</label>
    <input name="ccname" id="frmNameCC" required placeholder="Full Name" autocomplete="cc-name">
    
    <label for="frmCCNum">Card Number</label>
    <input name="cardnumber" id="frmCCNum" required autocomplete="cc-number">
    
    <label for="frmCCCVC">CVC</label>
    <input name="cvc" id="frmCCCVC" required autocomplete="cc-csc">
    
    <label for="frmCCExp">Expiry</label>
    <input name="cc-exp" id="frmCCExp" required placeholder="MM-YYYY" autocomplete="cc-exp">
    

**Forms best practices**

1. **Use `labels` on form inputs**, and ensure they're visible when the
   field is in focus. The label element provides direction to the user, telling
   them what information is needed in a form element. Each label is associated
   with an input element by placing it inside the label element. Applying labels
   to form elements also helps to improve the touch target size: the user can
   touch either the label or the input in order to place focus on the input
   element.
1. **Use `placeholder` to provide guidance** about what you expect. The
   placeholder attribute provides a hint to the user about what's expected in
   the input, typically by displaying the value as light text until the user
   starts typing in the element. Placeholders disappear as soon as the user
   starts typing in an element, thus they are not a replacement for labels. They
   should be used as an aid to help guide users on the required format and
   content.
