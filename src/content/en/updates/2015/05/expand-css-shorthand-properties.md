In the styles pane, you can expand CSS shorthand properties like <code>flex</code> or <code>padding</code> and see the full range of properties which are defined for you. E.g.

<pre>
<code>flex: 0 0 45%;
</code>
</pre>

Translates to:

<pre>
<code>flex-grow: 0;
flex-shrink: 0;
flex-basis: 45%;
</code>
</pre>

Just click the small arrow near the shorthand property to expand it.
