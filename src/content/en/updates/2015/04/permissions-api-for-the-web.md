# Permissions API for the Web {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/mattgaunt.html" %}

If you've worked with the [Geolocation
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
before, chances are you've wanted to check if you had permission to use
Geolocation without causing a prompt. This simply wasn't possible. You had to request the current position and this would indicate the permission state or cause a prompt to be shown to the user.  

Not all APIs work this way. The Notifications API has its own way of allowing
you to check the current permission state via
[Notification.permission](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#permission).

As the web platform grows in API's, there needs to be a single, standard way for
developers to check the status of a permission rather than having to remember
how each and every API works. The [Permission
API](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/){: .external }, available in [Chrome version 43](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6376494003650560), is
intended to be this single, standard way to check the permission status of an API.

## permissions.query()

Check the status of a permission using the `permissions.query()` method. This will
[return a status](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#h-status-of-a-permission) of granted (you have permission), denied (you are blocked from
accessing the API) or
prompt (user needs
to be prompted). For example:


    // Check for Geolocation API permissions  
    navigator.permissions.query({name:'geolocation'})
      .then(function(permissionStatus) {  
        console.log('geolocation permission state is ', permissionStatus.state);
    
        permissionStatus.onchange = function() {  
          console.log('geolocation permission state has changed to ', this.state);
        };
      });
    

The query method takes a
[PermissionDescriptor](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#h-permission-descriptor)
object, where you define the permission's name. The response is a Promise
resolving to a
[PermissionStatus](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#idl-def-PermissionStatus)
object. From this object, you can check the state with `permissionStatus.state`
for 'granted', 'denied' or 'prompt'. You can also also implement an event
handler for `permissionStatus.onchange` and handle changes to the permission
state.

### Supported PermissionDescriptors

In the above example, we highlight how to query the permission state for
geolocation with the following permission descriptor: `{name:'geolocation'}`.  

The Notification permission descriptor is similar in that it only requires a
name attribute: `{name:'notifications'}`.

[Push](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#h-push) and
[midi](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#h-midi) each have an additional
parameter that is specific to that API.

For the push permission, you can supply a `userVisibleOnly` parameter.
This indicates whether you wish to show a notification for every push message
or be able to send silent push notifications (At the moment Chrome only
supports push messages with notifications). You'd use it like so:


    navigator.permissions.query({name:'push', userVisibleOnly:true})
    

Midi allows a `sysex` parameter. This indicates whether you need to and/or receive
system exclusive messages. For midi this would be:


    navigator.permissions.query({name:'midi', sysex:true})
    

## Requesting Permissions

Requesting permission from the user depends on the specific API. For example,
geolocation would show a permission prompt when you call `getCurrentPosition()`.


    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {  
      console.log('Geolocation permissions granted');  
      console.log('Latitude:' + position.coords.latitude);  
      console.log('Longitude:' + position.coords.longitude);  
    });
    

Whereas notifications would prompt the user when you call `requestPermission()`.


    Notification.requestPermission(function(result) {  
      if (result === 'denied') {  
        console.log('Permission wasn\'t granted. Allow a retry.');  
        return;  
      } else if (result === 'default') {  
        console.log('The permission request was dismissed.');  
        return;  
      }  
      console.log('Permission was granted for notifications');  
    });
    

The point here is that the Permission API allows a consistent way to monitor the
status of permissions while being able to support the range of APIs currently on
the web.

The big advantage of this is that it allows you to build better experiences for
your users, only prompting when it's obvious to the user why you need extra
privileges and taking full advantage of these APIs when you know you have been
granted permission.

## Browser Support

Chrome is the first browser to implement this, Mozilla are planning on shipping
this, and Microsoft have shown interest in the API.

## Known Issues

* Geolocation will not re-show a prompt if the user dismisses the permission
  request. The permission status however remains 'prompt'.
