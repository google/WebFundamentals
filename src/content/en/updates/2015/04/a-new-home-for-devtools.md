# A new home for DevTools {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/pbakaus.html" %}



When you're reading this, you're probably already close to our new home at [https://developers.google.com/web/](/web/), Google's new one-stop destination for everything web-related.

Naturally, DevTools had to join the party so we've moved our main homepage – along with many of our tutorials – over to [http://developers.google.com/web/chrome-devtools](/web/chrome-devtools/). But don't let the new shiny fool yourself: We have plenty of content additions and more substantial changes for you.

## Goal-oriented tutorials

All of our in-depth tutorials that show you how to use DevTools most efficiently are now goal-oriented, similar to how [Web Fundamentals](/web/fundamentals) structures its pages. They now not only focus on DevTools itself, but include all of our tools needed to make you productive as web developer. So instead of "Learn everything about the network panel", you'll get "Optimize your network performance".

Head over to the [Setup section](/web/tools/setup/) to get started.

## Updates, news and useful tips

Inspired by the fantastic [devtoolstips.com](http://devtoolstips.com/){: .external } and [Umar's on Twitter](https://twitter.com/umaar), and with the help of both, we've launched a new updates section that features the latest DevTools news, extensions and useful advice.

We will still do occasional blogs on the [Chromium blog](http://blog.chromium.org/){: .external }, but they'll be abbreviated and link out to our very own blog here.

Let us know what you think and come by often!
