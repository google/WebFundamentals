# Rolling out Public Key Pinning with HPKP Reporting {: .page-title }

Using SSL on your site is an important way to preserve security and privacy for your users. 
But enabling SSL isn’t the end of the story: there are many steps you can take to further
enhance the security that your site provides, from setting the [Secure attribute](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag) on your 
cookies to turning on [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to using [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) to 
lock down your site’s privileges. Deploying these powerful features can sometimes be 
tricky, though. To help you roll out a stricter form of SSL, Chrome 46 ships with a feature 
called HPKP reporting.

### What do all these acronyms mean?

Security on the web today relies on SSL certificates: cryptographic signatures 
proving that a website is who it says who it is. When your browser sends a 
request to a URL such as [https://developers.google.com](), the server 
provides an SSL certificate, and if the certificate is valid, the browser allows 
the request to proceed and shows the website URL with a green padlock in the 
address bar.

What is a valid certificate, though? To be considered valid, a certificate must 
be signed by a certificate authority (CA), or by another certificate that was 
signed by a CA (known as an intermediate CA). Browsers and operating systems 
ship with a list of several hundred CAs that are trusted to issue certificates. 
The problem, though, is that by default, any of these CAs can issue certificates 
for _any_ website. If any one of them is compromised or misbehaving, that could 
be devastating for the entire web.

Enter HTTP Public Key Pinning, or HPKP. This standard allows websites to send an 
HTTP header instructing the browser to remember (or "pin") parts of its SSL 
certificate chain. The browser will then refuse subsequent connections that 
don't match the pins that it has previously received. Here's an example of an 
HPKP header:

<pre><code>Public-Key-Pins:  
       pin-sha256="d6qzRu9zOECb90Uez27xWltNsj0e1Md7GkYYkVoZWmM=";  
       pin-sha256="LPJNul+wow4m6DsqxbninhsWHlwfp0JecwQzYpOLmCQ=";  
       max-age=259200
</code></pre>

This header specifies two certificate hashes as pins. One is a hash of a 
certificate in the site's certificate chain, and the other is a backup pin, or a 
hash of a certificate that the site can use in the event that it needs to rotate 
its certificate. The header also includes a `max-age` value. After that number of 
seconds elapses, the browser will forget about the pin.

For more about HPKP in general, check out [the spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469) 
or fellow Chrome developer Chris Palmer's excellent 
[blog post](https://noncombatant.org/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/).

### Should I go turn on HPKP right now?

Not necessarily. When you deploy HPKP, it's quite easy to make a mistake and 
accidentally DoS your site. If you pin your site to one set of certificates and 
then have to deploy a new one, users who have seen the pin will be unable to 
access your site until the pin expires (based on the `max-age` value in the 
header).

Because it's tricky to get right, HPKP is mostly used by a handful of 
high-profile, security-sensitive sites right now. If you decide to turn on HPKP, 
you should start with a very short max-age value and gradually increase it if 
you don't have any problems.

### What's HPKP reporting and how does it help?

HPKP reporting, shipping in Chrome 46, is a feature that you can use to detect 
misconfigurations as you're rolling out HPKP.

First, you can start by sending the `Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only` header instead 
of the Public-Key-Pins header:

<pre><code>Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only: 
       max-age=2592000;  
       pin-sha256="E9CZ9INDbd+2eRQozYqqbQ2yXLVKB9+xcprMF+44U1g=";  
       pin-sha256="LPJNul+wow4m6DsqxbninhsWHlwfp0JecwQzYpOLmCQ=";  
report-uri="https://example.net/pkp-report"
</code></pre>

When your site sends such a header, Chrome will verify if the current connection 
matches the pins, and sends a report to the `report-uri` if not. Chrome will never 
block requests based on the pins in a Report-Only header, so this is a safe way 
to try out HPKP and see if it causes problems for your users without running the 
risk of DoSing your site.

Note that a Report-Only header only applies to the request on which it is 
received. The browser doesn't remember Report-Only pins as it does for real 
pins. This allows you test your configuration without worrying about caching bad 
values in your users' browsers, and you can roll out incrementally (for example, 
just on a single resource) to avoid flooding your server with reports.

When you roll out the real `Public-Key-Pins` header to start enforcing your pins, 
you can include a report-uri value in that header as well, so that you will 
continue to get reports if any problems occur.

### What goes in a HPKP violation report?

An HPKP violation report is a JSON message sent in an HTTP POST request to your 
configured `report-uri`. The list of fields can be found in the 
[spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469#section-3), but I'll highlight two of 
them here: `served-certificate-chain` and `validated-certificate-chain`. The 
`served-certificate-chain` is the certificate exactly as Chrome received it when 
setting up the SSL connection for the request. The `validated-certificate-chain`, 
on the other hand, is the chain that Chrome rebuilt when trying to validate the 
server's certificate, which, surprisingly, can be different than the 
`served-certificate-chain`. Different clients perform certificate validation in 
different ways, and this can be a common cause of HPKP misconfigurations. Be 
sure to check this field if you are receiving unexpected reports.

### One last "gotcha"

If you're deploying HPKP reporting, remember that Chrome does pin validation for 
all requests—including report-sending requests. So if you have deployed HPKP 
for your site, you probably want to send HPKP reports to a different domain that 
you have not pinned. Otherwise, a pin violation on your site will trigger a 
report to the same domain, which will also fail pin violation, and thus you will 
not receive the report.

If you don't have another domain handy, you could instead try a service such as 
report-uri.io, which handles violation reports for you.
