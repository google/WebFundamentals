# HTML5 Libraries - Late June {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/paulirish.html" %}


Some exciting libraries have cropped up lately:

<a href="http://paperjs.org/">Paper.js</a> - a vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of &lt;canvas>. It is based on and largely compatible with <a href="https://scriptographer.org/" target="_blank">Scriptographer</a>, a scripting environment for Adobe Illustrator. If you've ever wanted an object model to sit above canvas, take a peek.

<a href="https://github.com/RSamaium/RPG-JS">RPG JS</a> - a role playing game framework for 2D games that leverages <a href="https://www.createjs.com/easeljs">EaselJS</a> for its scene graph. Can use many <a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/rpg-maker-xp">RPG Maker XP</a> assets to get a quick head start.

<a href="http://www.idangero.us/cs/">Chop Slider</a> - making heavy use of CSS transitions and effects to get impressive transitions between states.
