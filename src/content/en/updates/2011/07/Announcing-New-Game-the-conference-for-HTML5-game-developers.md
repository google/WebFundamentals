# Announcing New Game, the conference for HTML5 game developers {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/sethladd.html" %}


Please join us at [New Game](http://newgameconf.com), to be held November 1-2, 2011 in San Francisco, CA.  New Game is the first HTML5 game conference for North America.

Our theme is "HTML5 games are here today" and the conference will feature speakers building and releasing production HTML5 games for desktop, laptop, and mobile.

Darius Kazemi from Bocoup is the conference director, and Google is the premier sponsor of the event.

A [Call for Participation](//goo.gl/iWA2J) is now open, if you are building real HTML5 games today, we want to help you tell your story.  Potential topics can include multi-player HTML5 games over Websockets, HTML5 audio and the Web Audio API, debriefs of production releases of HTML5 games, WebGL, asset pipelines, and business models.

See you at New Game this fall!
