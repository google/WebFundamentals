If your browser supports WebGL try this <a href="http://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_cars.html">awesome demo</a> so you can drive a car in 3D with no plugins at all. We are seeing more and more developers coming up with new 3D demos whether they were OpenGL experts already or new adventurers that <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/three/intro/">started</a> <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/">playing</a> with it.

To make developer's life easier there is the well known <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</a> library, that abstracts the native methods to increase your productivity. The aforementioned demo is obviously using it too. 
Our in-house expert, <a href="http://fhtr.org/">Ilmari Heikkinen</a>, has built some <a href="http://fhtr.org/BasicsOfThreeJS">interactive slides</a> to guide you through the creation process step by step. Enjoy!
