# Workers â™¥ ArrayBuffer {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/ericbidelman.html" %}


As of <strike>[crbug.com/73313](https://crbug.com/73313)</strike>, Chrome 13 and FF5 support sending an `ArrayBuffer` (or Typed Array) to/from a Web Worker. For example:

*worker.js*


    self.onmessage = function(e) {
      var uInt8Array = e.data;
      postMessage("Inside worker.js: uInt8Array.toString() = " + uInt8Array.toString());
      postMessage("Inside worker.js: uInt8Array.byteLength = " + uInt8Array.byteLength);
    };
    

*main.html*


    var uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(10));
    for (var i = 0; i < uInt8Array.length; ++i) {
      uInt8Array[i] = i * 2; // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8,...]
    }
    
    console.log('uInt8Array.toString() = ' + uInt8Array.toString());
    console.log('uInt8Array.byteLength = ' + uInt8Array.byteLength);
    
    worker.postMessage(uInt8Array);
    

Why is this exciting?...binary data!

Instead of the browser serializing your `postMessage()` data to a JSON object, it uses the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/The_structured_clone_algorithm) to copy the `ArrayBuffer` to the worker's context, and vice versa. This opens up a real potential for workers that we haven't seen before. That is, being able to easily pass binary data between main app and worker thread.

Typed array I/O makes intense image manipulation, sound processing, and heavy webgl calculations much more feasible. For example, one could [read a File as an array buffer](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/#toc-reading-files) or [fetch a Blob using XHR2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/#toc-reponseTypeArrayBuffer) and pass the result directly to a worker. No more base64 encoding the data :)

In my opinion this is one of those nitpicks workers should have included from the start. It just makes sense.
