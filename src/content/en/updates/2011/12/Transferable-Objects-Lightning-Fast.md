# Transferable Objects: Lightning Fast! {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/ericbidelman.html" %}


Chrome 13 introduced sending `ArrayBuffer`s to/from a Web Worker using an algorithm called [structured cloning](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/09/Workers-ArrayBuffer). This allowed the `postMessage()` API to accept messages that were not just strings, but complex types like `File`, `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, and JSON objects. Structured cloning is also supported in later versions of Firefox.

### Faster is better

Structured cloning is great, but it's still a copy operation. The overhead of passing a 32MB `ArrayBuffer` to a Worker can be hundreds of milliseconds.
New versions of browsers contain a huge performance improvement for message passing, called [Transferable Objects](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/common-dom-interfaces.html#transferable-objects).

With transferable objects, data is transferred from one context to another. It is zero-copy, which vastly improves the performance of sending data to a Worker. Think of it as pass-by-reference if you're from the C/C++ world. However, unlike pass-by-reference, the 'version' from the calling context is no longer available once transferred to the new context. For example, when transferring an `ArrayBuffer` from your main app to Worker, the original `ArrayBuffer` is cleared and no longer usable. Its contents are (quiet literally) transferred to the Worker context.

To play with transferables, there's a new version of `postMessage()` that supports transferable objects:


    worker.webkitPostMessage(arrayBuffer, [arrayBuffer]);
    window.webkitPostMessage(arrayBuffer, targetOrigin, [arrayBuffer]);
    

For the worker case, the first argument is the `ArrayBuffer` message. The second argument is a list of items that should be transferred.

### Benchmark demo

To see the performance gains of transferrables, I've put together [a demo](http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/workers/transferables/index.html).

The demo sends a 32MB `ArrayBuffer` to a worker and back using `webkitPostMessage()`. If your browser doesn't support transferables, the sample falls back to structured cloning. Averaging 5 runs in different browsers, here's what I got:

On a MacBook Pro/10.6.8/2.53 GHz/Intel Core 2 Duo, FF was the fastest using structured cloning. On average, it took 302ms to send the 32MB `ArrayBuffer` to a worker and post it back to the main thread (RRT - Round Trip Time). Comparing that with transferables, the same test took 6.6ms. That is a huge perf boost!

Having these kinds of speeds allows massive WebGL textures/meshes to be seamlessly passed between a Worker and main app.

### Feature detecting

Feature detecting is a bit tricky with this one. My recommendation is to send a small `ArrayBuffer` to your worker. If the buffer is transferred and not copied, its `.byteLength` will go to 0:


    worker.postMessage = worker.webkitPostMessage || worker.postMessage;
    
    var ab = new ArrayBuffer(1);
    worker.postMessage(ab, [ab]);
    if (ab.byteLength) {
      alert('Transferables are not supported in your browser!');
    } else {
      // Transferables are supported.
    }
    

*Support:* Currently Chrome 17+, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and IE10+

*Updated (2011-12-13):* Code snippet to show `webkitPostMessage()` signature is different for window and worker.
