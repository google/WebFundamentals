Have you ever wanted to let the browser know about an important font, script, or
other resource that will be needed by the page, without delaying the page's
`onload` event? `<link rel="preload">` gives web developers to power to do just
that, using a familiar HTML element syntax with a few key attributes to
determine the exact behavior. It’s a
[draft standard](http://w3c.github.io/preload/) that’s shipping as part of the
[Chrome 50 release](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5757468554559488).

Resources loaded via `<link rel="preload">` are stored locally in the browser,
and are effectively inert until they’re referenced in the DOM, JavaScript, or
CSS. For example, here’s one potential use case in which a script file is
preloaded, but not executed immediately, as it would have been if it were
included via a `<script>` tag in the DOM.

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="preload" href="used-later.js" as="script">
<!-- ...other HTML... -->
<script>
  // Later on, after some condition has been met, we run the preloaded
  // JavaScript by inserting a <script> tag into the DOM.
  var usedLaterScript = document.createElement('script');
  usedLaterScript.src = 'used-later.js';	
  document.body.appendChild(usedLaterScript)
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

So what's happening here? The [`href` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-href) used in that example should
be familiar to web developers, as it’s the standard attribute used to specify
the URL of any linked resource.

The [`as` attribute](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#widl-HTMLLinkElement-as) is
probably new to you, however, and it’s used in the context of a `<link>` element
to give the browser more context about the
[destination](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination) of
preloading request being made. This additional information ensures that the
browser will set appropriate request headers, request priority, as well as apply
any relevant [Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/)
directives that might be in place for the correct resource context.

to using `<link rel="preload">`. If you’re intrigued and want to start using it
on your own pages, I’d recommend reading through his article to learn more about
the benefits and creative use cases.

## Goodbye &lt;link rel="subresource">

`<link rel="preload">` supersedes `<link rel="subresource">`, which has
significant [bugs and drawbacks](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/preload-what-is-it-good-for/#didnt-we-already-have-that), and
which was never implemented in browsers other than Chrome. As such, Chrome 50
[removes support](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6596598008119296) for
`<link rel="subresource">`.
