In nearly every version of Chrome we see a significant number of updates and
improvements to the product, its performance, and also capabilities of the web
platform.

## Deprecation policy

To keep the platform healthy we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform which
have run their course.  There can be many reasons why we would remove an API, such
as: they are superseded by newer APIs, are updated to reflect changes to
specifications, to bring alignment and consistency with other browsers, or are
early experimentations that never came to fruition in other browsers and thus 
can increase the burden of support for web developers.

Some of these changes might have an effect on a very small number of sites and
to mitigate issues ahead of time we try to give developers advanced notice so
that if needed they can make the required changes to keep their sites running.

Chrome currently has a
[process for deprecations and removals of API's](http://www.chromium.org/blink#TOC-Launch-Process:-Deprecation)
and the TL;DR is:

* Announce on blink-dev
* Set warnings and give time scales in the developer console of the browser when
  usage is detected on a page
* Wait, monitor and then remove feature as usage drops

You can find a list of all deprecated features in
[chromestatus.com using the deprecated filter](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#deprecated)
and removed features by applying the
[removed filter](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#removed). We will also 
try to summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in 
these posts.

In Chrome 49 (Beta Feb 2nd, 2016. Estimated stable date: March 2016) there are a
number of changes to Chrome

## Use of "css" prefix in getComputedStyle(e).cssX is deprecated

**TL;DR**: The use of the "css" prefix in
[`getComputedStyle(e)`](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=413205)
has been deprecated since it was not a part of the formal
[spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle).

* [Intent to Remove](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/SX901460nbI)
* [Chromestatus Tracker](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5006796888473600)
* [CRBug Issue](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=413205)

`getComputedStyle` is a great little function.  It will return all CSS values of
the DOM element's styles as they have been computed by the rendering engine.  So
for example, you could run `getComputedStyle(_someElement_).height` and it might
return 224.1px because that is the height of the element as it is currently
displayed.

It seems quite a handy API. So what are we changing?

Before the rendering engine of Chrome changed to Blink, it was powered by
WebKit and that had let you prefix "css" to the start of a property.  For
example `getComputedStyle(e).cssHeight` instead of `getComputedStyle(e).height`.
Both would return the same data as they mapped to the same underlying values,
but it is this usage of the "css" prefix that is non-standard and has been
deprecated and removed.

Note - `cssFloat` is a standard property and is not affected by this deprecation.

If you access a property this way in Chrome 49 it will return `undefined` and you
will have to fix your code.

## Use of initTouchEvent is deprecated.

**TL;DR**:
[`initTouchEvent`](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#dictionary-toucheventinit-members)
has been deprecated in favor of the
[`TouchEvent`](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#touch-interface)
[`constructor`](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#touch-interface) to improve
spec compliance and will be removed altogether in Chrome 53.

[CRBug Issue](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=522100)

For a long time you have been able to create synthetic touch events in Chrome
using the `initTouchEvent` API, these are frequently used to simulate Touch Events
either for testing or automating some UI in your site.  In Chrome 49 we have
deprecated this API and will display the following warning with the intention 
to remove it completely in Chrome 53.

  <figcaption>
    'TouchEvent.initTouchEvent' is deprecated and will be removed in M53, 
    around September 2016. Please use the TouchEvent constructor instead. See
    <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5730982598541312">
    https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5730982598541312</a> for more details.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

There are a number of reasons why [this change is good](https://miketaylr.com/posts/2015/09/init-touch-event-is-a-rats-nest.html).
It is also not in the Touch Events spec. The Chrome implementation of
`initTouchEvent` was not compatible at all with Safari's `initTouchEvent` API and
was different to Firefox on Android's. And finally, the `TouchEvent` constructor
is a lot easier to use.

It was decided that we will aim to follow the spec rather than maintain an API
that is neither specced nor compatible with the only other implementation.
Consequently we are first deprecating and then removing the `initTouchEvent`
function and requiring developers to use the `TouchEvent` constructor.

There **is** usage of this API on the Web but we know it is used by a relatively
low number of sites so we are not removing it as quickly as we might normally.
We do believe that some of the usage is broken due to sites not handling
Chrome's version of the signature.

Because the iOS and Android/Chrome implementations of the `initTouchEvent` API
were so wildly different you would often have some [code along the lines
of](https://gist.github.com/basecss/8666646) (frequently forgetting Firefox)

{% highlight javascript %}
var event = document.createEvent('TouchEvent');

if(ua === 'Android') {
  event.initTouchEvent(touchItem, touchItem, touchItem, "touchstart", window,
    300, 300, 200, 200, false, false, false, false);
} else {
  event.initTouchEvent("touchstart", false, false, window, 0, 300, 300, 200,
    200, false, false, false, false, touches, targetTouches, changedTouches, 0, 0);
}

document.body.dispatchEvent(touchEvent);
{% endhighlight %}

Firstly, this is bad because it looks for "Android" in the User-Agent and Chrome
on Android will match and hit this deprecation.  It can't be removed just yet
though because there will be other WebKit and older Blink based browsers on
Android for a while that you will still need to support the older API.

To correctly handle `TouchEvents` on the web you should change your code to
support Firefox, IE Edge, and Chrome by checking for the existence of `TouchEvent`
on the `window` object and if it has a positive "length" (indicating it's a
constructor that takes an argument) you should use that.

{% highlight javascript %}
if('TouchEvent' in window && TouchEvent.length > 0) {
  var touch = new Touch({
    identifier: 42,
    target: document.body,
    clientX: 200,
    clientY: 200,
    screenX: 300,
    screenY: 300,
    pageX: 200,
    pageY: 200,
    radiusX: 5,
    radiusY: 5
  });

  event = new TouchEvent("touchstart", {
    cancelable: true,
    bubbles: true,
    touches: [touch],
    targetTouches: [touch],
    changedTouches: [touch]
  });
}
else {
  event = document.createEvent('TouchEvent');

  if(ua === 'Android') {
    event.initTouchEvent(touchItem, touchItem, touchItem, "touchstart", window,
      300, 300, 200, 200, false, false, false, false);
  } else {
    event.initTouchEvent("touchstart", false, false, window, 0, 300, 300, 200,
      200, false, false, false, false, touches, targetTouches, 
      changedTouches, 0, 0);
  }
}

document.body.dispatchEvent(touchEvent);
{% endhighlight %}

## Error and success handlers required in RTCPeerConnection methods

**TL;DR:** The [WebRTC](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/)
RTCPeerConnection methods [`createOffer()`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#widl-RTCPeerConnection-createOffer-Promise-RTCSessionDescription--RTCOfferOptions-options)
and [`createAnswer()`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#widl-RTCPeerConnection-createAnswer-Promise-RTCSessionDescription--RTCAnswerOptions-options)
now require an error handler as well as a success handler. Previously it had 
been possible to call these methods with only a success handler. That usage is
deprecated.

In Chrome 49 we've also added a warning if you call 
[`setLocalDescription()`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#widl-RTCPeerConnection-setLocalDescription-Promise-void--RTCSessionDescriptionInit-description) 
or [`setRemoteDescription()`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#widl-RTCPeerConnection-setRemoteDescription-Promise-void--RTCSessionDescriptionInit-description)
without supplying an error handler. We expect to make the error handler 
argument mandatory for these methods in Chrome 50.

This is part of clearing the way for introducing promises on these methods, 
as required by the [WebRTC spec](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/).

Here's an example from the WebRTC
[RTCPeerConnection demo](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/pc1/)
([main.js, line 126](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/blob/gh-pages/src/content/peerconnection/pc1/js/main.js#L126)):

{% highlight javascript %}
function onCreateOfferSuccess(desc) {
  pc1.setLocalDescription(desc, function() {
     onSetLocalSuccess(pc1);
  }, onSetSessionDescriptionError);
  pc2.setRemoteDescription(desc, function() {
    onSetRemoteSuccess(pc2);
  }, onSetSessionDescriptionError);
  pc2.createAnswer(onCreateAnswerSuccess, onCreateSessionDescriptionError);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that both `setLocalDescription()` and `setRemoteDescription()` always had an error
handler parameter, so simply specifying that parameter is a safe change.

In general, for production WebRTC applications we recommend that you use
[`adapter.js`](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter),  a shim, maintained by the
WebRTC project, to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences.

## Document.defaultCharset is deprecated

**TL;DR**: [`Document.defaultCharset`](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/58) has
been deprecated to improve spec compliance.

[Intent to Remove](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/dqlJguVuIHs)
[Chromestatus Tracker](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5730982598541312)
[CRBug Issue](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=522100)

The `Document.defaultCharset` is a read-only property that returns the default
character encoding of the user's system based on their regional settings.  It's
not been found to be useful to maintain this value because of the way that
browsers use the character encoding information in the HTTP Response or in the
meta tag embedded in the page.

By using document.characterSet you will get the first value specified in the
HTTP header. If that is not present then you will get the value specified in the
`charset` attribute of the `<meta>` element (for example, `<meta charset="utf-8">`).
Finally if none of those are available the `document.characterSet` will be the 
user's system setting.

Gecko has not supported this property and it is not cleanly specced so this
property will be deprecated from Blink in Chrome 49 (Beta in January 2016).  The
following warning will appear in your console until the removal of the property
in Chrome 50:

<figure>
  <img src="/web/updates/images/2016/02/chrome-49-deprecations/image01.png" />
  <figcaption>
    'Document.defaultCharset' is deprecated and will be removed in M50, around
    April 2016. See <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features/6217124578066432">

## getStorageUpdates() removed

**TL;DR**: `Navigator.getStorageUpdates()` has been removed as it is no longer in the
[Navigator spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator).

[Intent to Remove](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/ak1kVjiX9T4/mo1rqcyQAQAJ)
[Chromestatus Tracker](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/4780366799831040)
[CRBug Issue](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=465255)

If this impacts anyone I will eat my hat. `getStorageUpdates()` has hardly ever
(if at all) been used on the web.

To quote the (very old version) of the HTML5 spec:

> If a script uses the
> [`document.cookie`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-html5-20090423/dom.html#dom-document-cookie)
> API, or the `localStorage` API, the browser will block other scripts from
> accessing cookies or storage until the first script finishes.
>
> Calling the
> [`navigator.getStorageUpdates()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-html5-20090423/browsers.html#dom-navigator-getstorageupdates)
> method tells the user agent to unblock any other scripts that may be blocked,
> even though the script hasn't returned.
>
> Values of cookies and items in the Storage objects of `localStorage` attributes
> can change after calling this method, whence its name.

Sounds pretty cool right? The spec even uses the word "whence" (which by
happenstance is the only instance of whence in the spec).  At the spec level
there was a `StorageMutex` that controlled access to blocking storage such as
`localStorage` and cookies, and this API would help free that mutex so other
scripts would not be blocked by this `StorageMutex`.  But it was never
implemented, it's not supported in IE or Gecko, and WebKit's (and thus Blink's)
implementation has been a no-op.

It's been removed from the specs for quite a while and has been removed
completely from Blink (for the longest time it has been a no-op and did
nothing even if called).

In the unlikely event that you had code that called `navigator.getStorageUpdates()`
then you will have to check for the presence of the function before calling it.

## Object.observe() is deprecated

**TL;DR**: `Object.observe()` has been deprecated as it is [no longer on the
standardization track](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/an-update-on-object-observe)
and will be removed in a future release.

[Intent to Remove](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/v8-users/12NbuZ4BB7A)
[Chromestatus Tracker](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/6147094632988672)
[CRBug Issue](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162553)

In November 2015 it was announced that [`Object.Observe` was being withdrawn from
TC39](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/an-update-on-object-observe).  It has been
deprecated from Chrome 49 and you will see the following warning in the console
if you try to use it:

  <img src="/web/updates/images/2016/02/chrome-49-deprecations/image02.png" />
  <figcaption>
    'Object.observe' is deprecated and will be removed in M50, around April

Many developers liked this API and if you have been experimenting with it and
are now seeking a transition path, consider using a polyfill such as
[MaxArt2501/object-observe](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/object-observe) or a
wrapper library like
[polymer/observe-js](https://github.com/polymer/observe-js).
