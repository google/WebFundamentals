When a `pushsubscriptionchange` event occurs, it's an opportunity for a developer
to re-subscribe the user for push. One of the pain points of this is that to
re-subscribe a user, the developer has to keep the `applicationServerKey` (and any
other `subscribe()` options) in sync between the web page's JavaScript and their
service worker.

In Chrome 54 and later you can now access the options via the options parameter
in a subscription object, known as
[PushSubscriptionOptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/#pushsubscriptionoptions-dictionary).

You can copy and paste the following code snippet into
[simple-push-demo](https://gauntface.github.io/simple-push-demo/) to see what
the options look like. The code simply gets the current subscription and prints
out `subscription.options`.

{% highlight javascript %}
    navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(registration => {  
      return registration.pushManager.getSubscription();  
    })  
    .then(subscription => {  
      if (!subscription) {  
        console.log('No subscription ðŸ˜ž');  
        return;  
      }

      console.log('Here are the options ðŸŽ‰');  
      console.log(subscription.options);  
    });
{% endhighlight %}

With this small piece of information you can re-subscribe a user in the
[pushsubscriptionchange](https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/#the-pushsubscriptionchange-event)
event like so:

{% highlight javascript %}
    self.addEventListener('pushsubscriptionchange', e => {  
      e.waitUntil(registration.pushManager.subscribe(e.oldSubscription.options)  
        .then(subscription => {  
          // TODO: Send new subscription to application server  
        }));  
    });
{% endhighlight %}

It's a small change, that will be super useful in the future.
