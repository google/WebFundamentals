What if I told you websites could communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices
in a secure and privacy-preserving way? This way, heart rate monitors, singing
lightbulbs, [turtles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LV1Fk5ZXwA) and [flying
grumpy cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRMcMDIyIGQ) could interact
directly with a website.

Until now, the ability to interact with bluetooth devices has been possible
only for native apps. The Web Bluetooth API aims to change this and brings it
to web browsers as well. Alongside efforts like [Physical
Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/), people can walk up to and
interact with devices straight from the web. Check out this [drone controlled
from a web app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yILD_ZdXJW4) video to get a
sense of how that would work.

## Before we start

This article assumes you have some basic knowledge of how Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) and the [Generic Attribute Profile
(GATT)](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/GATT.aspx)
work.

Even though the [Web Bluetooth API
specification](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) is not
finalized yet, the Chrome Team is actively looking for enthusiastic developers
(I mean you) to try out this work-in-progress API and give
[feedback on the spec](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/issues) and
[feedback on the implementation](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?components=Blink%3EBluetooth).

Web Bluetooth API is currently available to be enabled experimentally on your
origin in Origin Trials, or locally on your machine using an experimental flag.
The implementation is partially complete and currently available on Chrome OS,
Chrome for Android M, Linux, and Mac.

Go to `chrome://flags/#enable-web-bluetooth`, enable the highlighted flag,
restart Chrome and you should be able to
[scan for](#scan-for-bluetooth-devices) and [connect to](#connect-to-a-bluetooth-device)
nearby Bluetooth devices,
[read](#read-a-bluetooth-characteristic)/[write](#write-to-a-bluetooth-characteristic)
Bluetooth characteristics, [receive GATT Notifications](#receive-gatt-notifications) and know when a [Bluetooth device gets
disconnected](#get-disconnected-from-a-bluetooth-device).

### Available for Origin Trials

In order to get as much feedback as possible from developers using the Web
Bluetooth API in the field, we're also adding this feature in Chrome 53 as an
[origin trial](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md) for Chrome
OS, Android M, and Mac. **Origin Trials allow you to temporarily enable the
feature for all of users of your website.** During the origin trial, the API may
still change in backward-incompatible ways before we freeze it into the web
platform.  To use this experimental API in Chrome with no flag, you'll need to
[request a token for your origin](http://bit.ly/WebBluetoothOriginTrial) and
[insert it in your application](https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md).

The trial will end in January 2017. By that point, we expect to have figured
out any changes necessary to stabilize the feature and move it out from Origin
Trials.

## Security Requirements

### HTTPS Only

Because this experimental API is a powerful new feature added to the Web,
Google Chrome aims to make it available only to [secure
contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#intro). This
means you'll need to build with TLS in mind.

> We care deeply about security, so you will notice that new Web capabilities
require HTTPS. The Web Bluetooth API is no different, and is yet another good
reason to get HTTPS up and running on your site.

During development you'll be able to interact with Web Bluetooth through
http://localhost by using tools like the [Chrome Dev
Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg)
or the handy `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, but to deploy it on a site you'll
need to have HTTPS set up on your server. I personally enjoy [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com) for demo purposes.

To add HTTPS to your server you'll need to get a TLS certificate and set
it up. Be sure to check out the [Security with HTTPS
article](/web/fundamentals/security/)
for best practices there. For info, you can now get free TLS certificates with
the new Certificate Authority [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### User Gesture Required

As a security feature, discovering nearby Bluetooth devices with
`navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` must be called via a user gesture
like a touch or mouse click.

## Get into the Code

The Web Bluetooth API relies heavily on JavaScript
[Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
If you're not familiar with them, check out this great
[Promises tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/). One
more thing, `() => {}` are simply ECMAScript 2015 [Arrow
functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
-- they have a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically
bind the `this` value.

### Scan for Bluetooth Devices

This version of the Web Bluetooth API specification allows websites,
running in the Central role, to connect to remote GATT Servers over a BLE
connection. It supports communication among devices that implement
Bluetooth 4.0 or later.

When a website requests access to nearby devices using
`navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice`, Google Chrome will prompt user with a
device chooser where they can pick one device or simply cancel the request.

<img style="width:723px; max-height:250px" src="/web/updates/images/2015-07-22-interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web/bluetooth-device-chooser.png" alt="Bluetooth Device Chooser screenshot"/>

The `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` function takes a mandatory Object that
defines filters. These filters are used to return only devices that match some
advertised Bluetooth GATT services and/or the device name.

For instance, scanning for Bluetooth devices advertising the [Bluetooth GATT Battery Service](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.battery_service.xml) is this simple:

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ filters: [{ services: ['battery_service'] }] })
.then(device => { /* ... */ })
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });
{% endhighlight %}

If your Bluetooth GATT Service is not on the list of [the standardized Bluetooth
GATT
services](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx)
though, you may provide either the full Bluetooth UUID or a short 16- or 32-bit
form.

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
  filters: [{
    services: [0x1234, 0x12345678, '99999999-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb']
  }]
})
.then(device => { /* ... */ })
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });
{% endhighlight %}

You can also scan for Bluetooth devices based on the device name being
advertised with the `name` filters key, or even a prefix of this name with the
`namePrefix` filters key. Note that in this case, you will also need to define
the `optionalServices` key to be able to access some services. If you don't,
you'll get an error later when trying to access them.

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
  filters: [{
    name: 'Francois robot'
  }],
  optionalServices: ['battery_service']
})
.then(device => { /* ... */ })
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });
{% endhighlight %}

### Connect to a Bluetooth Device

So what do you do now that you have a `BluetoothDevice` returned from
`navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice`'s Promise? Let's connect to the Bluetooth
remote GATT Server which holds the service and characteristic definitions.

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ filters: [{ services: ['battery_service'] }] })
.then(device => {
  // Human-readable name of the device.
  console.log(device.name);
  // Filtered UUIDs of GATT services the website origin has access to.
  console.log(device.uuids);

  // Attempts to connect to remote GATT Server.
  return device.gatt.connect();
})
.then(server => { /* ... */ })
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });
{% endhighlight %}

### Read a Bluetooth Characteristic

Here we are connected to the GATT Server of the remote Bluetooth device. Now we
want to get a Primary GATT Service and read a characteristic that belongs to
this service. Let's try, for instance, to read the current charge level of the
device's battery.

In the example below, `battery_level` is the [standardized
Battery Level
Characteristic](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/characteristics/Pages/CharacteristicViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.characteristic.battery_level.xml).

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ filters: [{ services: ['battery_service'] }] })
.then(device => device.gatt.connect())
.then(server => {
  // Getting Battery Service...
  return server.getPrimaryService('battery_service');
})
.then(service => {
  // Getting Battery Level Characteristic...
  return service.getCharacteristic('battery_level');
})
.then(characteristic => {
  // Reading Battery Level...
  return characteristic.readValue();
})
.then(value => {
  console.log('Battery percentage is ' + value.getUint8(0));
})
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });
{% endhighlight %}

If you use a custom Bluetooth GATT characteristic, you may provide either the
full Bluetooth UUID or a short 16- or 32-bit form to `service.getCharacteristic`.

Note that you can also add a `characteristicvaluechanged` event listener on a
characteristic to handle reading its value. Check out [Read Characteristic Value Changed Sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/read-characteristic-value-changed.html) 
to see how to optionally handle upcoming GATT notifications as well.

{% highlight javascript %}
...
.then(characteristic => {
  // Set up event listener for when characteristic value changes.
  characteristic.addEventListener('characteristicvaluechanged',
                                  handleBatteryLevelChanged);
  // Reading Battery Level...
  return characteristic.readValue();
})
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });

function handleBatteryLevelChanged(event) {
  let batteryLevel = event.target.value.getUint8(0);
  console.log('Battery percentage is ' + batteryLevel + '%');
}
{% endhighlight %}


### Write to a Bluetooth Characteristic

Writing to a Bluetooth GATT Characteristic is as easy as reading it. This time,
let's use the Heart Rate Control Point to reset the value of the Energy
Expended field to 0 on a heart rate monitor device.

I promise there is no magic here. It's all explained in the [Heart Rate
Control Point Characteristic
page](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/characteristics/Pages/CharacteristicViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.characteristic.heart_rate_control_point.xml).

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ filters: [{ services: ['heart_rate'] }] })
.then(device => device.gatt.connect())
.then(server => server.getPrimaryService('heart_rate'))
.then(service => service.getCharacteristic('heart_rate_control_point'))
.then(characteristic => {
  // Writing 1 is the signal to reset energy expended.
  var resetEnergyExpended = new Uint8Array([1]);
  return characteristic.writeValue(resetEnergyExpended);
})
.then(_ => {
  console.log('Energy expended has been reset.');
})
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });
{% endhighlight %}

### Receive GATT Notifications

Now, let's see how to be notified when the [Heart Rate Measurement](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/characteristics/Pages/CharacteristicViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.characteristic.heart_rate_measurement.xml)
characteristic changes on the device:

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ filters: [{ services: ['heart_rate'] }] })
.then(device => device.gatt.connect())
.then(server => server.getPrimaryService('heart_rate'))
.then(service => service.getCharacteristic('heart_rate_measurement'))
.then(characteristic => {
  return characteristic.startNotifications()
  .then(_ => {
    characteristic.addEventListener('characteristicvaluechanged',
                                    handleCharacteristicValueChanged);
  });
})
.then(_ => {
  console.log('Notifications have been started.');
})
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });

function handleCharacteristicValueChanged(event) {
  var value = event.target.value;
  console.log('Received ' + value);
  // TODO: Parse Heart Rate Measurement value.
  // See https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/demos/blob/gh-pages/heart-rate-sensor/heartRateSensor.js
}
{% endhighlight %}

The [Notifications Sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/notifications.html)
will show you to how to stop notifications with `stopNotifications()` and
properly remove the added `characteristicvaluechanged` event listener.

### Get disconnected from a Bluetooth Device

To provide a better user experience, you may want to show a warning message if
the `BluetoothDevice` gets disconnected to invite the user to reconnect.

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({ filters: [{ name: 'Francois robot' }] })
.then(device => {
  // Set up event listener for when device gets disconnected.
  device.addEventListener('gattserverdisconnected', onDisconnected);

  // Attempts to connect to remote GATT Server.
  return device.gatt.connect();
})
.then(server => { /* ... */ })
.catch(error => { console.log(error); });

function onDisconnected(event) {
  let device = event.target;
  console.log('Device ' + device.name + ' is disconnected.');
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also call `device.gatt.disconnect()` to disconnect your web app from
the Bluetooth device. This will trigger existing `gattserverdisconnected` event
listeners. Note that it will NOT stop bluetooth device communication if another
app is already communicating with the Bluetooth device. Check out the [Device
Disconnect Sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/device-disconnect.html)
and the [Automatic Reconnect Sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/automatic-reconnect.html)
to dive deeper.

## Samples, Demos and Codelabs

## Libraries

- [&lt;platinum-bluetooth>](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/platinum-bluetooth?active=platinum-bluetooth-device) is a new set of [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) elements to discover and communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices based on the Web Bluetooth API.
- [web-bluetooth-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-bluetooth-utils) is a npm module that adds some convenience functions to the API.

## Tools

- [Get Started with Web Bluetooth](https://beaufortfrancois.github.io/sandbox/web-bluetooth/generator/) is a simple Web App that will generate all the JavaScript boilerplate code to start interacting with a Bluetooth device. Enter a device name, a service, a characteristic, define its properties and you’re good to go.
- If you’re already a Bluetooth developer, the [Web Bluetooth Developer Studio Plugin](https://github.com/beaufortfrancois/sandbox/tree/gh-pages/web-bluetooth/bluetooth-developer-studio-plugin) will also generate the Web Bluetooth JavaScript code for your Bluetooth device.

## Dev Tips

A Bluetooth Console is available in Chrome OS developer shell. Press [ Ctrl ] [
Alt ] [ T ] to open a browser tab terminal and use the `bt_console` command to
start poking around your bluetooth settings. The `help` command will give you a
list of all available commands.

I would recommend you check out the official [Bluetooth debug page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/how-tos/file-web-bluetooth-bugs) as debugging Bluetooth can be hard sometimes.

## What's next

Check the [browser and platform implementation
status](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md)
first to know which parts of the Web Bluetooth API are currently being implemented.

Though it's still incomplete, here's a sneak peek of what to expect in the
coming months:

- [Scanning for nearby BLE advertisements](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/pull/239)
  will happen with `navigator.bluetooth.requestLEScan()`.
- [Specifying the Eddystone upgrade](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/pull/230) will
  allow a website opened from a Physical Web notification, to communicate
  with the device that advertised its URL.
- A new `serviceadded` event will track newly discovered Bluetooth GATT Services
  while `serviceremoved` event will track removed ones. A new `servicechanged`
  event will fire when any characteristic and/or descriptor gets added or
  removed from a Bluetooth GATT Service.

At the time of writing, Chrome OS, Android M, Linux, and Mac are [the most advanced
platforms](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md).
Windows 8.1+ and iOS will be supported as much as feasible by the platforms.
