#Edge Of The Web \#8

### Chrome 47 (Beta)

* Chrome 47 has a new feature that makes it easier to understand the how users 
  interact with your site: 
  [InputDeviceCapabilities](http://rbyers.github.io/InputDevice/)!  You can learn more about this new feature at:
  [developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/inputdevicecapabilities](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/inputdevicecapabilities)<br/>
* [Adding a Splash screen for installed web apps in Chrome 
  47](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/splashscreen?hl=en)
  Over the past year we have focused on letting developers build sites and apps that feel like they are installed on the user’s system: Service Worker for letting you easily build offline first experiences and Add to Homescreen to give your site the presence on the user’s device. This home screen launch process on Android is a great first step.

* Detecting if a web app is **[launched from the home 
  screen](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/display-mode?hl=en)**
  During the past year we have focused on enabling users to build app like 
  experiences on the web by making it possible for apps to work offline using 
  [Service 
  Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers) 
  and to get a presence on the home screen using the [Web App 
  Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/simplified-app-installs). 
  Now apps tend to offer different experiences as sites, and developers might 
  want to offer different experiences depending on whether the site is viewed in 
  the browser or launched as a standalone web app, from the home screen.
* **Touch to Search** launched in June of 2015 on Chrome 43 for most Android 
  phones. When the user taps text on any page in Chrome, the word is selected 
  along with relevant surrounding text. The search term appears in a bar at the 
  bottom of the screen, which users can open in an overlay panel to show full 
  search results. [Learn how to control 
  it](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/tap-to-search?hl=en).
* More **DevTools** improvements for you! Re-order DevTools tabs which ever way 
  suits you best; see exactly where framework events were bound and block 
  network requests to see which third party scripts slow you down. [Read all 
  about 
  it](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/devtools-digest-reordering-tabs?hl=en).

### On the web

* The **[AMP Project](https://www.ampproject.org/)** kicked-off with the initial 
  iteration of AMP HTML, with WordPress providing a plugin at launch.  Consider how to integrate [AMP HTML](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) into your CMS, and provide any feedback on missing features or technical 
  direction.<br/> Short background on the project: Smartphones and tablets have revolutionized 
  the way we access information, and today people consume a tremendous amount of 
  news on their phones. Publishers around the world use the mobile web to reach 
  these readers, but the experience can often leave a lot to be desired. Every 
  time a web page takes too long to load, they lose a reader—and the opportunity 
  to earn revenue through advertising or subscriptions. <br/>
  <br/>
  The solution we announced earlier this month is a new open source initiative 
  called [Accelerated Mobile Pages](http://www.ampproject.org/), which aims to 
  dramatically improve the performance of the mobile web. <br/>

* **[The Chrome Dev Summit](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit)** is 
  taking place in two weeks!<br/>
  It is an exclusive event to connect with Chrome engineers and leading web 
  developers for a two-day exploration of building beautiful and fast mobile web 
  applications. The event is sold out but you can still join us on the 
  [livestream](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/cds/) as we explore how to 
  build the new generation of web apps with DevTools, Service Worker and the new 
  suite of APIs coming to the web.  Check out the 
  [schedule](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule).

* **navigator.mediaDevices()** - Modern browsers make it possible to 
  select input and output devices including cameras, microphones and speakers. 
  For example: On a phone, select the front or rear-facing camera. On a laptop, 
  choose the internal speakers or a speaker connected by Bluetooth. For a video 
  chat, choose internal or external microphone or camera. All this functionality 
  is exposed by the _MediaDevices_ object, which is returned by navigator.mediaDevices()<br/>
