### Chrome for Android 

**Media controls**  
On Android, native apps can show media controls in a system notification when 
playing audio, making it easy for users to control audio while multitasking. 
Chrome 45 brings this capability to the web by showing a notification with media 
controls when audio is playing in web content. The[ 
](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/media-notifications)[controls 
will automatically show 
up](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/media-notifications) when 
&lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; tags play audio longer than 5 seconds. It will 
look like this:

### Latest From Search

#### Released Search Analytics API!
[Released the Search Analytics API](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/08/introducing-search-analytics-api.html) to allow developers to access data from the [Search Analytics feature](https://goo.gl/TFyN7c) in Search Console. The API makes it easy to create new dashboards that provide  information about keywords, clicks, and impressions from search to the sites powered by your  CMS.   
[Contact us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wxSUDjz14G2gRIZmJeYwapUm8Eh9l-oYTX4GgFZPdjA/viewform?usp=send_form) [if you wish to use our APIs to build a Google search dashboard for your users](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wxSUDjz14G2gRIZmJeYwapUm8Eh9l-oYTX4GgFZPdjA/viewform?usp=send_form)

* **Other APIs news**

Restricted unauthorized access to the unpublished search auto complete API as of August 10th, 2015. We have an alternative for users still wanting to maintain the auto complete service for their website. [Read on here for more details](http://goo.gl/KFCXCe).

* **Website security**
    * Over the past year Google has noticed a 180% increase in the number of 
      sites getting hacked. 

<img src="/web/updates/images/2015-08-28-edge-of-the-wed-6/image01.png" width="262" height="130" />

* Back in July we kicked off a second iteration of our \#_NoHacked_ campaign  [on our official Webmasters Blog](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com), to support users in protecting their websites from being hacked. If you missed it, read the first post of the series [here](http://goo.gl/2Mds0O), and get in touch with us if you want to collaborate on this front.

### Mobile search results

* **Google+ Case Study on its app download interstitial**: we published a case 
  study to illustrate how the Google+ team decided to retire its intrusive app 
  download interstitial in favor of a [Smart App 
  Banner](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/common-mistakes/avoid-interstitials). 
  The decision was based on data, internal UX studies and live experiments. For 
  more, [read on here](http://goo.gl/SiwrgC).
