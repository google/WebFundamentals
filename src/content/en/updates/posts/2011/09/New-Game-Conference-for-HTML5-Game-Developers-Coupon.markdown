Oh, I didn't see you there! I was too busy playing awesome HTML5 games.
</p>

<p>
You, too, can keep me from completing my TPS reports by learning how to write HTML5 and WebGL games at <a href="http://www.newgameconf.com">New Game, the conference for HTML5 game developers</a>. Use this nifty HTML5ROCKS coupon to <a href="http://newgame.eventbrite.com">register</a> for 15% off.
</p>

<p>
You don't build games? You'll learn mad Canvas, WebGL, performance, and JavaScript skillz at New Game. Nothing pushing the limits of a platform like video games.
</p>

<p>
We've put together a smashing lineup, with keynotes from EA's Rich Hilleman and Zynga's Paul Bakaus. Speakers from Google, Mozilla, Spil, Moblyng, Opera, Gamesaland, and more will educate and amaze (edumaze?) you with deep technical content from real life examples of building and launching HTML5 games.
</p>

<p>
Learn WebGL from Ken Russell, learn Canvas from Grant Skinner, learn how to bring your iOS games to the web from Miguel Angel Pastor, just to name a few.
</p>

<p>
You need a party to cool off from all that brain melting? Yeah, we got that, too. Complete with DJ.  (Disclaimer: DJ is not written in HTML5)
</p>

<p>
New Game will be held Nov 1-2, 2011 in San Francisco in the beautiful Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. As far as we can tell, it's the only conference in North America dedicated to building high fidelity games for the modern browser.
