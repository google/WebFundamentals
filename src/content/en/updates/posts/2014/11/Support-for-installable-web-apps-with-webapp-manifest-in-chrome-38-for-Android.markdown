For Web Apps to be successful, they need to work how the user would expect a native application to work. The ability for the developer to control how their web app is launched is just one part of UX that needs to be solved.

The [Manifest for Web applications](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) is a simple JSON file that gives you, the developer, the ability to control how your app appears to the user in the areas that they would expect to see apps (for example the mobile home screen), direct what the user can launch and, more importantly, *how* they can launch it.  In the future the manifest will give you even more control over your app, but right now we are just focusing on how your app can be launched.

Chrome has had support for Manifests since version 38 for Android (October 2014) and it gives you the control over how your web app appears when it is installed to the home screen (via the `short_name`, `name` and `icons` properties) and how it should be launched when the user clicks on the launch icon (via `start_url`, `display` and `orientation`).  Check out [our sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/web-application-manifest) to see this in action.

# Deploying the manifest

To integrate the manifest in your own site you just need to do two things:

1.  Create and deploy a manifest file.
2.  Add a `link` element from the pages in your app pointing to the manifest file.

## Creating the manifest

You can call the manifest whatever you want.  Most people will probably just use `manifest.json`.

An example manifest is shown below. It doesn't show everything that can be in a manifest. For that you can check out the [reference on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).

{% highlight json %}
{
  "short_name": "Kinlan's Amaze App",
  "name": "Kinlan's Amazing Application ++",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "launcher-icon-2x.png",
      "sizes": "96x96",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "launcher-icon-3x.png",
      "sizes": "144x144",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "launcher-icon-4x.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "landscape"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Some interesting points in Chrome's implementation:

*  The `short_name` is preferred over `name` and if provided will be used.
   * Note: [as of Chrome 42](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en), you
     should also provide a `name` which will be used for the App Install Banner.
*  If you don't supply a `start_url` it will use the current page's URL.
*  Chrome will [first look for icons](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/android/webapps/add_to_homescreen_data_fetcher.cc&l=115) that match the density of the display and are sized to [48dp * screen density](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/android/shortcut_helper.cc&l=42). If none are found it will search for the icon that closest matches the device characteristics. If, for whatever reason, you want be specific about targetting an icon at a particular pixel density, you can use the [`density` member](http://w3c.github.io/manifest/#display-member). The `density` member takes a number. When you don't declare `density`, it just defaults to "1", which means "use this icon for screen densities 1.0 and up", which is normally what you want.

## Telling the browser about your manifest

Once you have the manifest created and it is hosted on your site, all you need to do is add a `link` tag from all your pages that encompass your app, as follows:

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
{% endhighlight %}

That's it.

# What every developer should do today

This feature is entirely progressive and allows you create better, more integrated experiences for users of a browser that supports the feature.  As of Jan 2016, Chrome, Firefox and Opera have implemented the manifest, and [IE is exploring the area](https://status.modern.ie/webapplicationmanifest?term=manifest).

When a user adds your site or app to the home screen, there is an intent by the user to treat it like an app.  This means you should aim to direct the user to the functionality of your app rather than a product landing page. For example, if the user is required to sign-in to your app, then that is a good page to launch.

For every type of app you are always going to do the following:

*  Create the manifest
*  Create beautiful icons
*  Set the `start_url`

## Utility Apps

The majority of utility apps will benefit from this immediately.  You'll more than likely want to launch as a standalone experience, much like every other app on a mobile platform. Tell it to launch `standalone`:

{% highlight javascript %}
"display": "standalone"
{% endhighlight %}

## Games

The majority of games will benefit from a manifest immediately.  The vast majority of games will want to launch full-screen straight away and be forced into a [specific orientation](https://w3c.github.io/screen-orientation/#idl-def-OrientationLockType).

If you are developing a vertical scroller or a game like Flappy Birds then you will most likely want your game to always be in portrait mode.

{% highlight javascript %}
"display": "fullscreen",
"orientation": "portrait"
{% endhighlight %}

If on the other hand you are building a puzzler or a game like X-Com, then you will probably want the game to always use the landscape orientation.

{% highlight javascript %}
"display": "fullscreen",
"orientation": "landscape"
{% endhighlight %}

## News Sites

News sites in most cases are pure content-based experiences.  Most developers naturally wouldn't think of adding a manifest to a news site.

However, if you want your site to have all the browser chrome that you would expect a content site to have, you can set the display to `browser`.

{% highlight javascript %}
"display": "browser"
{% endhighlight %}

Taking a look at native apps, the majority of news-centric apps treat their experiences as apps and remove all web-like chrome from the UI.  This is easy to do by setting `display` to `standalone`.

{% highlight javascript %}
"display": "standalone"
{% endhighlight %}

# Detecting if you are launched from the home screen

A question that keeps popping up about Chrome's implementation of "mobile-web-app-capable" is: How can I tell if
I am running as launched from the home screen?  On iOS you can use `navigator.standalone` to see if it is running
like a native app, but we don't have this on Chrome for Android. [Instead](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=289113), you should [use the `display-mode`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/display-mode) media query feature.



# Learning More

Check out Chrome's guidance for [adding to the home screen](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen#supporting) and [HTML5Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/web-manifest-specification/) for a deeper dive in
to where the future of the spec and implementations will be.

## Diving deep

Let's face it, the majority of us love to see under the hood about how a feature is implemented - it lets us learn more about the systems and also helps us track when changes occur that might give us early access to new features for our users.

If, like me, you are interested in how this is implemented in Chrome, here are some useful links:

*  The [logic for extracting the data](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/android/shortcut_helper.cc) from the manifest and managing how to use the fallback
*  Check [OnDidGetManifest](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/android/webapps/add_to_homescreen_data_fetcher.cc&l=105&q=ondidgetmanifest) - this is where Chrome does all the grunt work and you can see what parameters are supported.
*  The code for showing the [Add to home screen UI](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/webapps/AddToHomescreenDialog.java)

# We crave feedback

This spec is a critical part in bringing Web Apps to all users and we need your feedback. You can help us in a number of ways:

*  Add it to your site and tell us what needs work and what works well (adding comments here is a good start).
*  Let us know of good practices you have discovered
*  [Contribute to the specification](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) and give the team feedback.
