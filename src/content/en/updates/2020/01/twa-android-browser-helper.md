# Introducing android-browser-helper, a library for building Trusted Web Activities {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/andreban.html" %}

We have released version [1.0.0][9] of, [android-browser-helper][1], a new Android Library for
[Trusted Web Activity (TWA)][8] which, besides being built on top of the modern
[Android JetPack][2] libraries, makes it easier for developers to use Trusted Web Activity to build
their Android applications.

**android-browser-helper is now the recommended library to build applications that use Trusted Web
Activity.**

The library is hosted on the official [Google Maven repository][11], which works out of the box in
Android Projects, and is also compatible with AndroidX, which was a common [issue][12] with the
previous library.

More features and development experience improvements will be added this library. This is a short
list of what has already been added:

 - Handles opening the content in a browser that supports TWA and, if one is not installed,
implements a fallback strategy.
 - Makes the fallback strategy customizable, so developers can customize how their application
 behaves when a browser the supports TWA is not installed. The [twa-webview-fallback][3] demo shows
 how to use a fallback strategy that uses the [Android WebView][6], for example.
 - Makes configuring TWAs that work with multiple origins easier, as illustrated on the 
[twa-multi-domain][4] demo.

The library can be added to Android application by using the following dependency to the
appllication `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    //...
    implementation 'com.google.androidbrowserhelper:androidbrowserhelper:1.0.0'
}
```

## Migrating from the custom-tabs-client
Developers who were using the previous [`custom-tabs-client`][5] will have to implement a few
changes in their application, when migrating to `android-browser-helper`.

Fortunately, besides replacing using the old library with the new library, those changes mainly
involve changing searching and replacing a few strings throughout `AndroidManifest.xml`. 

Hereâ€™s a summary of the names changed:

| Name on custom-tabs-client (Old Library)                     | Name on android-browser-helper (New Library)              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| android.support.customtabs.trusted.LauncherActivity          | com.google.androidbrowserhelper.trusted.LauncherActivity  |
| android.support.v4.content.FileProvider                      | androidx.core.content.FileProvider                        |
| android.support.customtabs.trusted.TrustedWebActivityService | com.google.androidbrowserhelper.trusted.DelegationService |

The [svgomg-twa demo][10] has been updated to use android-browser-helper. this [diff][7] shows all
the changes required when migrating an existing project using `custom-tabs-client` to
`android-browser-helper`.

## Are we missing anything?

android-browser-helper has the goal of simplifying the development of applications using Trusted
Web Activities. The library will continue to evolve as TWAs get more features.

If you are missing a feature in Trusted Web Activities, think of ways that
android-browser-helper could make make the development work simpler, or have a question on how to
use the library, make sure to pop by the [GitHub repository][1] and file an [issue][13].
