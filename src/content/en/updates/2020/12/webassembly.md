## The road so far {: #past }

A year ago, Chrome [announced initial support](/web/updates/2019/12/webassembly)
for native WebAssembly debugging in Chrome DevTools.

We demonstrated basic stepping support and talked about opportunities
usage of [DWARF](http://dwarfstd.org/) information instead of
source maps opens for us in the future:

> - Resolving variable names
> - Pretty-printing types
> - Evaluating expressions in source languages
> - …and much more!

Today, we’re excited to showcase the promised features come into life
and the progress Emscripten and Chrome DevTools teams have made over
this year, in particular, for C and C++ apps.

Before we start, please keep in mind that this is still a beta version
of the new experience, you need to use the latest version of all tools
at your own risk, and if you run into any issues, please report them to
[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=DevTools+issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=DevTools+issue).

Let’s start with the same simple C example as the last time:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void assert_less(int x, int y) {
  if (x >= y) {
    abort();
  }
}

int main() {
  assert_less(10, 20);
  assert_less(30, 20);
}
```

To compile it, we use [latest
Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk#downloads--how-do-i-get-the-latest-emscripten-build)
and pass a `-g` flag, just like in the original post, to include debug
information:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
emcc -g temp.c -o temp.html
</pre>

Now we can serve the generated page from a localhost HTTP server (for
example, with [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)), and
open it in the latest [Chrome
Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/).

This time we’ll also need a helper extension that integrates with Chrome
DevTools and helps it make sense of all the debugging information
encoded in the WebAssembly file. Please install it by going to this
link: [goo.gle/wasm-debugging-extension](https://goo.gle/wasm-debugging-extension)

You’ll also want to enable WebAssembly debugging in the DevTools
**Experiments**. Open Chrome DevTools, click the gear (**⚙**) icon in
the top right corner of DevTools pane, go to the **Experiments** panel
and tick **WebAssembly Debugging: Enable DWARF support**.

![Experiments pane of the DevTools settings](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image11.png)

When you close the **Settings**, DevTools will suggest to reload itself
to apply settings, so let’s do just that. That’s it for the one-off
setup.

Now we can go back to the **Sources** panel, enable **Pause on
exceptions** (⏸ icon), then check **Pause on caught exceptions** and
reload the page. You should see the DevTools paused on an exception:

![Screenshot of the Sources panel showing how to enable "Pause on caugh exceptions"](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image7.png)

By default, it stops on an Emscripten-generated glue code, but on the
right you can see a **Call Stack** view representing the stacktrace of
the error, and can navigate to the original C line that invoked
`abort`:

![DevTools paused in the `assert_less` function and showing values of `x` and `y` in the Scope view](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image9.png)

Now, if you look in the **Scope** view, you can see the original names
and values of variables in the C/C++ code, and no longer have to figure
out what mangled names like `$localN` mean and how they relate to the
source code you’ve written.

This applies not only to primitive values like integers, but to compound
types like structures, classes, arrays, etc., too!

## Rich type support {: #rich-types }

Let’s take a look at a more complicated example to show those. This
time, we’ll draw a [Mandelbrot
fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) with the
following C++ code:

```cpp
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>
#include <complex>

int main() {
  // Init SDL.
  int width = 600, height = 600;
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
  SDL_Window* window;
  SDL_Renderer* renderer;
  SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer(width, height, SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL, &window,
                              &renderer);

  // Generate a palette with random colors.
  enum { MAX_ITER_COUNT = 256 };
  SDL_Color palette[MAX_ITER_COUNT];
  srand(time(0));
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ITER_COUNT; ++i) {
    palette[i] = {
        .r = (uint8_t)rand(),
        .g = (uint8_t)rand(),
        .b = (uint8_t)rand(),
        .a = 255,
    };
  }

  // Calculate and draw the Mandelbrot set.
  std::complex<double> center(0.5, 0.5);
  double scale = 4.0;
  for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      std::complex<double> point((double)x / width, (double)y / height);
      std::complex<double> c = (point - center) * scale;
      std::complex<double> z(0, 0);
      int i = 0;
      for (; i < MAX_ITER_COUNT - 1; i++) {
        z = z * z + c;
        if (abs(z) > 2.0)
          break;
      }
      SDL_Color color = palette[i];
      SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, color.r, color.g, color.b, color.a);
      SDL_RenderDrawPoint(renderer, x, y);
    }
  }

  // Render everything we've drawn to the canvas.
  SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);

  // SDL_Quit();
}
```

You can see that this application is still fairly small – it’s a single
file containing 50 lines of code – but this time I’m also using some
external APIs, like [SDL
library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer) for
graphics as well as [complex
numbers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex) from the
C++ standard library.

I’m going to compile it with the same `-g` flag as above to include
debug information, and also I’ll ask Emscripten to provide the SDL2
library and allow arbitrarily-sized memory:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
emcc -g mandelbrot.cc -o mandelbrot.html \
     -s USE_SDL=2 \
     -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1
</pre>

When I visit the generated page in the browser, I can see the beautiful
fractal shape with some random colors:

![Demo page](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image15.png)

When I open DevTools, once again, I can see the original C++ file. This
time, however, we don’t have an error in the code (whew!), so let’s set
some breakpoint at the beginning of our code instead.

When we reload the page again, the debugger will pause right inside our
C++ source:

![DevTools paused on the `SDL_Init` call](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image3.png)

We can already see all our variables on the right, but only `width`
and `height` are initialized at the moment, so there isn’t much to
inspect.

Let’s set another breakpoint inside our main Mandelbrot loop, and resume
execution to skip a bit forward.

![DevTools paused inside the nested loops](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image6.png)

At this point our `palette` has been filled with some random colors,
and we can expand both the array itself, as well as the individual
`SDL_Color` structures and inspect their components to verify that
everything looks good (for example, that “alpha” channel is always set
to full opacity). Similarly, we can expand and check the real and
imaginary parts of the complex number stored in the `center` variable.

If you want to access a deeply nested property that is otherwise hard to
navigate to via the **Scope** view, you can use the **Console**
evaluation, too! However, note that more complex C++ expressions are not
yet supported.

![Console panel showing the result of `palette[10].r`](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image12.png)

Let’s resume execution a few times and we can see how the inner `x` is
changing as well – either by looking in the **Scope** view again, adding
the variable name to the watch list, evaluating it in the console, or by
hovering over the variable in the source code:

![Tooltip over the variable `x` in the source showing its value `3`](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image10.png)

From here, we can step-in or step-over C++ statements, and observe how
other variables are changing too:

![Tooltips and Scope view showing values of `color`, `point` and other variables](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image8.png)

Okay, so this all works great when a debug information is available, but
what if we want to debug a code that wasn’t built with the debugging
options?

## Raw WebAssembly debugging {: #raw }

For example, we asked Emscripten to provide a prebuilt SDL library for
us, instead of compiling it ourselves from the source, so – at least
currently – there’s no way for the debugger to find associated sources.
Let’s step-in again to get into the `SDL_RenderDrawColor`:

![DevTools showing disassembly view of `mandelbrot.wasm`](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image1.png)

We’re back to the raw WebAssembly debugging experience.

Now, it looks a bit scary and isn’t something most Web developers will
ever need to deal with, but occasionally you might want to debug a
library built without debug information – whether because it’s a
3<sup>rd</sup>-party library you have no control over, or because you’re
running into one of those bugs that occurs only on production.

To aid in those cases, we’ve made some improvements to the basic
debugging experience, too.

First of all, if you used raw WebAssembly debugging before, you might
notice that the entire disassembly is now shown in a single file – no
more guessing which function a **Sources** entry `wasm-53834e3e/
wasm-53834e3e-7` possibly corresponds to.

### New name generation scheme {: #names }

We improved names in the disassembly view, too. Previously you’d see
just numeric indices, or, in case of functions, no name at all.

Now we’re generating names similarly to other disassembly tools, by
using hints from the [WebAssembly name
section](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/custom.html#name-section),
import/export paths and, finally, if everything else fails, generating
them based on the type and the index of the item like `$func123`. You can
see how, in the screenshot above, this already helps to get slightly
more readable stacktraces and disassembly.

When there is no type information available, it might be hard to inspect
any values besides the primitives – for example, pointers will show up
as regular integers, with no way of knowing what’s stored behind them in
memory.

### Memory inspection {: #memory-inspector }

Previously, you could only expand the WebAssembly memory object –
represented by `env.memory` in the **Scope** view – to look up
individual bytes. This worked in some trivial scenarios, but wasn’t
particularly convenient to expand and didn’t allow to reinterpret data
in formats other than byte values. We’ve added a new feature to help
with this, too: a linear memory inspector.

If you right-click on the `env.memory`, you should now see a new
option called **Inspect memory**:

![Context menu on the `env.memory` in the Scope pane showing an "Inspect Memory" item](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image4.png)

Once clicked, it will bring up a **Memory Inspector**, in
which you can inspect the WebAssembly memory in hexadecimal and ASCII views,
navigate to specific addresses, as well as interpret the data in
different formats:

![Memory Inspector pane in DevTools showing a hex and ASCII views of the memory](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image14.png)

## Advanced scenarios and caveats {: #advanced }

### Profiling WebAssembly code {: #profiling }

When you open DevTools, WebAssembly code gets “tiered down” to an
unoptimized version to enable debugging. This version is a lot slower,
which means that you can’t rely on `console.time`, `performance.now`
and other methods of measuring speed of your code while DevTools are
open, as the numbers you get won’t represent the real-world performance
at all.

Instead, you should use the DevTools [Performance
panel](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference)
which will run the code at the full speed and provide you with a
detailed breakdown of the time spent in different functions:

![Profiling panel showing various Wasm functions](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image2.png)

Alternatively, you can run your application with DevTools closed, and
open them once finished to inspect the **Console**.

We’ll be improving profiling scenarios in the future, but for now it’s a
caveat to be aware of. If you want to learn more about WebAssembly
tiering scenarios, check out our docs on [WebAssembly compilation
pipeline](https://v8.dev/docs/wasm-compilation-pipeline).

### Building and debugging on different machines (including Docker / host) {: #path-mapping }

When building in a Docker, virtual machine, or on a remote build server,
you will likely run into situations where the paths to the source files
used during the build don’t match the paths on your own filesystem where
the Chrome DevTools are running. In this case, files will show up in the
**Sources** panel but fail to load.

To fix this issue, we have implemented a path mapping functionality in
the C/C++ extension options. You can use it to remap arbitrary paths and
help the DevTools locate sources.

For example, if the project on your host machine is under a path
`C:\src\my_project`, but was built inside a Docker container where
that path was represented as `/mnt/c/src/my_project`, you can remap
it back during debugging by specifying those paths as prefixes:

![Options page of the C/C++ debugging extension](/web/updates/images/2020/12/webassembly/image13.png)

The first matched prefix “wins”. If you’re familiar with other C++
debuggers, this option is similar to the `set substitute-path` command
in GDB or a `target.source-map` setting in LLDB.

### Debugging optimized builds {: #release-builds }

Like with any other languages, debugging works best if optimizations are
disabled. Optimizations might inline functions one into another, reorder
code, or remove parts of the code altogether – and all of this has a
chance to confuse the debugger and, consequently, you as the user.

If you don’t mind a more limited debugging experience and still want to
debug an optimized build, then most of the optimizations will work as
expected, except for function inlining. We plan to address the remaining
issues in the future, but, for now, please use `-fno-inline` to
disable it when compiling with any `-O` level optimizations, e.g.:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
emcc -g temp.c -o temp.html \
     -O3 -fno-inline
</pre>

### Separating the debug information {: #separate-dwarf }

Debug information preserves lots of details about your code, defined
types, variables, functions, scopes, and locations – anything that might
be useful to the debugger. As a result, it often can be larger than the
code itself.

To speed up loading and compilation of the WebAssembly module, you might
want to split out this debug information into a separate WebAssembly
file. To do that in Emscripten, pass a `-gseparate-dwarf=…` flag with
a desired filename:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
emcc -g temp.c -o temp.html \
     -gseparate-dwarf=temp.debug.wasm
</pre>

In this case, the main application will only store a filename
`temp.debug.wasm`, and the helper extension will be able to locate and
load it when you open DevTools.

When combined with optimizations like described above, this feature can
be even used to ship almost-optimized production builds of your
application, and later debug them with a local side file. In this case,
we’ll additionally need to override the stored URL to help the extension
find the side file, for example:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
emcc -g temp.c -o temp.html \
     -O3 -fno-inline \
     -gseparate-dwarf=temp.debug.wasm \
     -s SEPARATE_DWARF_URL=file://[local path to temp.debug.wasm]
</pre>

## To be continued… {: #future-plans }

Whew, that was a lot of new features!

With all those new integrations, Chrome DevTools becomes a viable,
powerful, debugger not only for JavaScript, but also for C and C++ apps,
making it easier than ever to take apps, built in a variety of
technologies and bring them to a shared, cross-platform Web.

However, our journey is not over yet. Some of the things we’ll be
working on from here on:

- Cleaning up the rough edges in the debugging experience.
- Adding support for custom type formatters.
- Working on improvements to the
  [profiling](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference) for WebAssembly apps.
- Adding support for [code coverage](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage) to make it easier to find
  unused code.
- Improving support for expressions in console evaluation.
- Adding support for more languages.
- …and more!

Meanwhile, please help us out by trying the current beta on your own code and reporting any found
issues to
[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=DevTools+issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=DevTools+issue).

Stay tuned for future updates!
