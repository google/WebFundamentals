## Emulate vision deficiencies {: #vision-deficiencies }

Open the [Rendering tab](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#rendering)
and use the new **Emulate vision deficiencies** feature to get a better idea of how people with
different types of vision deficiencies experience your site.

DevTools can emulate blurred vision and the following
[types of color vision deficiencies](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/):

* Protanopia: the inability to perceive any red light.
* Deuteranopia: the inability to perceive any green light.
* Tritanopia: the inability to perceive any blue light.
* Achromatopsia: the inability to perceive any color except for shades of grey (extremely rare).

Less extreme versions of these color vision deficiencies exist, and in fact they are more common.
For example, _protanomaly_ is a reduced sensitivity to red light (as opposed to _protanopia_,
which is the complete inability to perceive red light). However, these “-omaly” vision
deficiencies are not as clearly defined: every person with such a vision deficiency is different
and might see things differently (being able to perceive more/less of the relevant colors).

By designing for the more extreme simulations in DevTools, your web apps are guaranteed to be
accessible to people with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, tritanomaly, and achromatomaly as well.

## Emulate locales {: #locales }

[lang]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language
[CM]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu

You can now emulate locales by setting a location in **Sensors** > **Location**. [Open the
**Command Menu**][CM] and type `Sensors` to access the **Sensors** tab. After performing these actions
DevTools modifies the current default locale, affecting the following:

- `Intl.*` APIs, e.g. `new Intl.NumberFormat().resolvedOptions().locale`
- other locale-aware JavaScript APIs such as `String.prototype.localeCompare` and
  `*.prototype.toLocaleString`, e.g. `123_456..toLocaleString()`
- DOM APIs such as `navigator.language` and `navigator.languages`
- the [`Accept-Language`][lang] HTTP request header

Note: updates to `navigator.language` and `navigator.languages` are not visible immediately, but only
after the next navigation or page reload. Changes to the `Accept-Language` HTTP header are only
reflected for subsequent requests.

yourself.

## Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP) debugging {: #COEP }

[COEP]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit#bookmark=id.uo6kivyh0ge2

The Network panel now provides [Cross-Origin Embedder Policy][COEP] debugging information.

The **Status** column now provides a quick explanation of why a request was blocked as well as a
link to view that request's headers for further debugging:

![Blocked requests in the Status column](/web/updates/images/2020/03/status.png)

The **Response Headers** section of the **Headers** tab provides more guidance on how to resolve
the issues:

## New icons for breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and logpoints {: #debugging-icons }

The **Sources** panel has new icons for breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and logpoints:

* [Breakpoints](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/breakpoints#loc)
  ![Breakpoint](/web/updates/images/2020/03/breakpoint.png){: .inline-icon }
  are represented by red circles.
* [Conditional Breakpoints](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/breakpoints#conditional-loc)
  ![Conditional Breakpoint](/web/updates/images/2020/03/conditional.png){: .inline-icon }
  are represented by half-red half-white circles.
* [Logpoints](/web/updates/2019/01/devtools#logpoints)
  ![Logpoint](/web/updates/images/2020/03/logpoint.png){: .inline-icon }
  are represented by red circles with Console icons.

The motivation for the new icons was to make the UI more consistent with other GUI debugging tools
(which usually color breakpoints red) and to make it easier to distinguish between the 3 features
at a glance.

## View network requests that set a specific cookie path {: #cookie-path }

[path]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Directives
[properties]: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference#filter-by-property

Use the new `cookie-path` filter keyword in the **Network** panel to focus on
the network requests that set a specific [cookie path][path].

Check out [Filter requests by properties][properties] to discover more special keywords
like `cookie-path`.

## **Dock to left** from the Command Menu {: #dock-to-left }

Open the [Command Menu](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu) and run the `Dock to left`
command to move DevTools to the left of your viewport.

![DevTools docked to the left of the viewport](/web/updates/images/2020/03/dock-to-left.png)

Note: DevTools has had the **Dock to left** feature for a long time but it was previously only
accessible from the [**Main Menu**](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/customize/placement#menu).
The new feature in Chrome 83 is that you can now access this feature from the Command Menu.

## The `Settings` option in the **Main Menu** has moved {: #settings }

[settings]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/customize#settings

The option for opening [Settings][settings] from the **Main Menu** can now be found under
**More Tools**.

## The **Audits** panel is now the **Lighthouse** panel {: #lighthouse }

The DevTools and Lighthouse teams frequently got feedback from web developers that they
would hear that it's possible to run [Lighthouse](/web/tools/lighthouse) from DevTools, but when
they went to try it out they couldn't find the "Lighthouse" panel, so the **Audits** panel is now the
**Lighthouse** panel.

## Delete all Local Overrides in a folder {: #overrides }

After setting up [Local Overrides](/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#overrides) you can now
right-click a folder and select the new **Delete all overrides** option to delete all
Local Overrides in that folder.

## Updated Long tasks UI {: #long-tasks }

A [Long Task](https://web.dev/long-tasks-devtools/#what-are-long-tasks) is JavaScript code that
monopolizes the main thread for a long time, causing a web page to freeze.

You've been able to [visualize Long Tasks in the Performance panel](https://web.dev/long-tasks-devtools/#are-there-long-tasks-in-my-page-that-could-delay-interactivity)
for a while now, but in Chrome 83 the Long Task visualization UI in the Performance panel has been updated.
The Long Task portion of a task is now colored with a striped red background.

## Maskable icon support in the Manifest pane {: #maskable-icons }

Android Oreo introduced adaptive icons, which display app icons in a variety
of shapes across different device models. [Maskable icons](https://web.dev/maskable-icon/)
are a new icon format that support adaptive icons, which enable you to ensure that
your [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps) icon looks good on devices that support the
maskable icons standard.

Enable the new **Show only the minimum safe area for maskable icons** checkbox in the
**Manifest** pane to check that your maskable icon will look good on Android Oreo
devices. Check out [Are my current icons ready?](https://web.dev/maskable-icon/#are-my-current-icons-ready)
to learn more.

![The "Show only the minimum safe area for maskable icons" checkbox](/web/updates/images/2020/03/maskable-icons.png)

Note: This feature launched in Chrome 81. We're covering it here in Chrome 83 because we forgot to cover it
in What's New In DevTools (Chrome 81).
