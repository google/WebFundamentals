Note: Chrome expects to start the spec-mandated turn down of AppCache in Chrome
85. For details and instructions for managing the transition gracefully, see
[Preparing for AppCache removal](https://web.dev/appcache-removal/). For
information on a feature that will help you identify uses of this and other
deprecated APIs, see [Know your code
health](https://web.dev/reporting-observer/)

## @import rules in CSSStyleSheet.replace() removed

The original spec for constructable stylesheets allowed for calls to:

```
sheet.replace("@import('some.css');")
```

This use case is being removed. Calls to `replace()` now throw an exception if
`@import` rules are found in the replaced content.
