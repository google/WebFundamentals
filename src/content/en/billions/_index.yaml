      <p>
        The next billion people coming online will be diverse in every respect:
        their location, cultural experience, computer expertise,
        connectivity access, and the kinds of devices they use.

        <h4>The next billion users will virtually all be on mobile</h4>
        <p>
          This presents unique challenges for web developers who must abandon
          the limited mobile first approach in favor of a comprehensive mobile
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can address these challenges by focusing a few key areas
          listed below.

    - heading: Design for seamless connectivity
      description: >
        Low bandwidth and intermittent connectivity are the norm for many
        people accessing the web. Most people online still have 2G connections
        or "3G" that downgrades to 2G. Even by 2020, more than 10% of users
        will still be on 2G. Many smartphones are used offline, and users
        regularly turn on airplane mode to avoid data consumption.

    - heading: Conserve data usage
      description: >
        High data cost is often a greater barrier to access than poor
        connectivity. Mobile users are cost-conscious; even "unlimited"
        plans can become expensive when roaming or if unexpected fees are
        applied. Many mobile users are extremely cost conscious, with good
        reason: for example, a 500MB data plan in India costs the same as 17
        hours of minimum wage work.

    - heading: Reduce battery consumption
      description: >
        Many people, even in urban areas, don't have access to a reliable and
        affordable power supply. This makes power conservation a critical
        factor in all app and content design.

    - heading: Optimize for device capability
      description: >
        Low spec is the norm. Globally, most new internet users have low-cost
        devices with basic hardware: single-core processors, 4" screens,
        limited memory, and limited storage.

    - heading: Build multi-device content
      description: >
        Large-layout, graphics-heavy content frustrates users and discourages
        them from using your app or site. Content that is too wide or too tall
        is overlooked by some users and deliberately avoided by others — and
        excess content adds page weight and data cost.

    - heading: "Transactions & monetization: think global"
      description: >
        Payment systems are inaccessible for many people on the web. Many
        users globally don't have bank accounts and don't use credit
        cards — including 8% of US households. Many payment systems don't work
        well on small viewports or with unreliable connectivity.

    - heading: Plan for localization
      description: >
        Localization can help you access new markets. Many websites are only
        published in English, but English is not the first language of most
        people online. Only 5.52% of the world's population are native English
        speakers and US or European cultural conventions may not be familiar
        or intuitive. Instructions or prompts that are succinct and compact
        in English may be verbose and obtrusive in other languages.
