          Events are run by Googlers, local Google Developer Groups or other
          developer meetups. Each event is a little different, but generally, an
          event can include a tech talk, series of code labs, and time for
          personal coding. Find one in your area or start your own!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're not able to find a nearby event don't worry! All the
          materials are available so you can organize your own event or
