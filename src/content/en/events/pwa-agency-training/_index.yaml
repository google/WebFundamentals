            Google is committed to building a better mobile web experience
            through Progressive Web Apps (PWA). As part of that goal, we are
            inviting web development agencies to apply to join an intensive 
            two-day PWA training course in the UK, India, and Indonesia.
          </p>
          <h3>Why build a Progressive Web App?</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="/web/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> are
            mobile user experiences that have the reach of the web and that are
            reliable, engaging, and fast. With more than half the views
            on the Internet done through mobile, delivering a great experience
            there is critical. In particular, PWAs make a significant impact on
            both customer acquisition and retention.

          <h3>About the training</h3>
          <p>
            The Progressive Web Apps Training for Agencies class is about 50%
            hands-on codelabs and compresses a three-day course into two days. 
            It covers the <a href="/training/courses/progressive-web-apps">
            Developing Progressive Web Applications syllabus</a> and is only 
            suitable for advanced web developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The training courses are run throughout the year in the UK, India,
            and Indonesia. We're focusing on agencies in these countries
            initially as we build our network of trainers and learn from the
            experience of running the course.

            We prioritize agencies that apply based on the perceived impact of
            the clients they work with, agency size, and whether the agency has
            already had team members trained. For now we are  capping the
            training at two attendees per company.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are accepted, we will contact you with course dates and
            details. We try to accommodate as many as we can, though we cannot
            guarantee everyone a place.
          </p>
