          What is a Polymer Polytechnic?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Polymer Polytechnic is an event series of in-person, community-run events to help developers learn Polymer. These events are run by local Google Developer Groups or other developer meetups all over the world. Each event is a little different, but generally, Polymer Polytechnic can include a tech talk, series of code labs, and time for personal hacking.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          Why is your team organizing this?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The Polymer team wants to help developers all over the world try this future facing technology. They also want to hear developer feedback as they continue to develop the product.

        <p class="faq-question">
          What hashtag do I use to talk about my Polymer Polytechnic on social media?

        <p class="faq-question">
          I'd like to organize a Polytechnic. Do we have to do events in the fall?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Nope! You can run a Polymer Polytechnic event any time!
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I'd like to organize my own Polytechinc event, are there specific things we
          should be talking about?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Polymer is very targeted at building mobile web apps, and client side apps in general. The design goal should be to compose your apps out of well encapsulated elements, like building blocks. Polymer is also a wonderful tool for creating mashups and componentizing APIs and services.
        </p>
