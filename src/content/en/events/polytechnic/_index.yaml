      - heading: What is a Polymer Polytechnic?
        description: >
          Polymer Polytechnic is an event series of in-person, community-run
          events to help developers learn Polymer. These events are run by
          local Google Developer Groups or other developer meetups all over
          the world. Each event is a little different, but generally, Polymer
          Polytechnic can include a tech talk, series of code labs, and time
          for personal hacking.

      - heading: Why is your team organizing this?
        description: >
          The Polymer team wants to help developers all over the world try
          this future facing technology. They also want to hear developer
          feedback as they continue to develop the product.

          I'd like to organize my own Polytechnic event, are there specific
          things we should be talking about?
        description: >
          Polymer is very targeted at building mobile web apps, and client
          side apps in general. The design goal should be to compose your
          apps out of well encapsulated elements, like building blocks.
          Polymer is also a wonderful tool for creating mashups and
          componentizing APIs and services.
