      - heading: What is a Progressive Web App Roadshow?
        description: >
          A Progressive Web App (PWA) Roadshow is an event series of
          in-person, community-run events to help developers learn how to
          build PWAs. These events are run by Googlers, local Google Developer
          Groups, or other developer meetups all over the world. Each event
          is a little different, but generally, a PWA Roadshow can include a
          tech talk, series of code labs, and time for personal hacking.

      - heading: Why is your team organizing them?
        description: >
          The Chrome team wants to help developers all over the world try
          these future facing technologies. We also want to hear developer
          feedback to better understand the challenges developers face when
          implementing PWAs so we can improve their experience.

      - heading: How do I add my event to the map?
        description: >
          If you’re already part of a Google Developer Group you’ll want to
          add your event to the <a href="/events">GDG
          Calendar</a> and use the tag “pwa roadshow”. For non-GDG events, you
          can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRn2mZNMZySA7lCksdNk3gw3jCbavkh04-98Fj6dxlRdwvSA/viewform">
          this form to add your event to the map</a>.

          I’d like to organize my PWA Roadshow event, do we have to do the

          Nope! You can run a PWA Roadshow event any time!

          I’d like to do the all day event, but I want to replace some of the
          talks. Can I remove some of the agenda items and add different
          sessions?
        description: >
          It is important not to drop any talks from the agenda, particularly
          to replace them with sessions on other topics, since they’re
          designed to give a complete understanding of Progressive Web Apps.
          If you don’t have enough time to cover all of the talks, we
          recommend instead using the Short event schedule, and adding more
          detail.
