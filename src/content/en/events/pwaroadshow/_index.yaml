          <p class="faq-question">
            What is a Progressive Web App Roadshow?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            A Progressive Web App (PWA) Roadshow is an event series of
            in-person, community-run events to help developers learn how to
            build PWAs. These events are run by Googlers, local Google Developer
            Groups, or other developer meetups all over the world. Each event
            is a little different, but generally, a PWA Roadshow can include a
            tech talk, series of code labs, and time for personal hacking.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            Why is your team organizing them?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The Chrome team wants to help developers all over the world try
            these future facing technologies. We also want to hear developer
            feedback to better understand the challenges developers face when
            implementing PWAs so we can improve their experience.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            How do I add my event to the map?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If you’re already part of a Google Developer Group you’ll want to
            add your event to the <a href="/events">GDG
            Calendar</a> and use the tag “pwa roadshow”. For non-GDG events, you
            can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRn2mZNMZySA7lCksdNk3gw3jCbavkh04-98Fj6dxlRdwvSA/viewform">
            this form to add your event to the map</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            What hashtag do I use to talk about PWA Roadshows on social media?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Great questions! Please use #pwaroadshow and be sure to follow and
            mention @ChromiumDev.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            I’d like to organize my PWA Roadshow event, do we have to do the
            events in September/November?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Nope! You can run a PWA Roadshow event any time!
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            I’d like to do the all day event, but I want to replace some of the
            talks. Can I remove some of the agenda items and add different
            sessions?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            It is important not to drop any talks from the agenda, particularly
            to replace them with sessions on other topics, since they’re
            designed to give a complete understanding of Progressive Web Apps.
            If you don’t have enough time to cover all of the talks, we
            recommend instead using the Short event schedule, and adding more
            detail.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            I’m excited about learning about Progressive Web Apps right now, and
            don’t want to wait for a PWA Roadshow event. What should I do?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            For a good overview of the major ideas behind Progressive Web Apps,
            take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jef9IluQw0">
            Alex Russell’s keynote</a> from the recent Progressive Web Apps
            Summit, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">

            I’d like to organize my own PWA Roadshow event, how do I get swag?

            If you are a GDG in need of support to get swag printed you should

          <p class="faq-question">
            Will Google help sponsor these PWA Roadshow events?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Venue, food, and other direct sponsorship will be handled at the
            local level. It will depend on local resource constraints and the
            specific of your event. If you are a GDG, please work with your

            Are the PWA Roadshow events official Google events?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Most PWA Roadshow events are produced by local developer
            communities, Google Developer Groups, meetups, or other
            organizations. Only the events marked on the map as “Official
            Google Event” are put on by Googlers.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            Should a PWA Roadshow event have a Code of Conduct?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes! It's important to make everyone feel safe and welcome at your
            event. We have provided a <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/pwa-roadshow-north-america/code-of-conduct/">
            Code of Conduct</a> that you may use for your own event.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">
            Are the PWA Roadshow events vetted by Google?
          </p>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The PWA Roadshow events listed on this site are not vetted by Google
            with the exception of those events marked on the map as official
            Google run events.
