        <p class="faq-question">
          What is a Progressive Web App Roadshow?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          A Progressive Web App (PWA) Roadshow is an event series of in-person,
          community-run events to help developers learn how to build PWAs.
          These events are run by Googlers, local Google Dveloper Groups, or
          other developer meetups all over the world. Each event is a little
          different, but generally, a PWA Roadshow can include a tech talk,
          series of code labs, and time for personal hacking.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          Why is your team organizing them?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The Chrome team wants to help developers all over the world try these
          future facing technologies. We also want to hear developer feedback
          to better understand the challenges developers face when implementing
          PWAs so we can improve their experience.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          What hashtag do I use to talk about PWA Roadshows on social media?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Great questions! Please use #pwaroadshow and be sure to follow and
          mention @ChromiumDev.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I’d like to organize my PWA Roadshow event, do we have to do the
          events in September/November?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Nope! You can run a PWA Roadshow event any time!
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I’d like to do the all day event, but I want to replace some of the
          talks. Can I remove some of the agenda items and add different
          sessions?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          It is important not to drop any talks from the agenda, particularly
          to replace them with sessions on other topics, since they’re designed
          to give a complete understanding of Progressive Web Apps. If you don’t
          have enough time to cover all of the talks, we recommend instead using
          the Short event schedule, and adding more detail.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          How do I add my event to the map?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          If you’re already part of a Google Developer Group you’ll want to add
          your event to the <a href="/events">GDG
          Calendar</a> and use the tag “pwa roadshow”. For non-GDG events, we’ll
          be rolling out a sign up process in the very near future. Stay tuned!
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          I’m excited about learning about Progressive Web Apps right now, and
          don’t want to wait for a PWA Roadshow event. What should I do?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          For a good overview of the major ideas behind Progressive Web Apps,

        <p class="faq-question">
          I’d like to organize my own PWA Roadshow event, how do I get swag?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          We've provided links to the swag designs in the resources section. If
          you are a GDG in need of support to get swag printed you should
          contact your regional lead.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          Will Google help sponsor these PWA Roadshow events?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Venue, food, and other direct sponsorship will be handled at the
          local level. It will depend on local resource constraints and the
          specific of your event. If you are a GDG, please work with your
          Google regional lead.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          Are the PWA Roadshow events official Google events?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Most PWA Roadshow events are produced by local developer communities,
          Google Developer Groups, meetups, or other organizations. Only the
          events marked on the map as “Official Google Event” are put on by
          Googlers.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          Should a PWA Roadshow event have a Code of Conduct?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes! It's important to make everyone feel safe and welcome at your
          event. We have provided a <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/pwa-roadshow-north-america/code-of-conduct/">
          Code of Conduct</a> that you may use for your own event.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question">
          Are the PWA Roadshow events vetted by Google?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The PWA Roadshow events listed on this site are not vetted by Google
          with the exception of those events marked on the map as official
          Google run events.
