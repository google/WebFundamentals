# Recording Video from the User {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/mscales.html" %}

Many browsers now have the ability to access video and audio input from the
user. However, depending on the browser it might be a full dynamic and inline
experience, or it could be delegated to another app on the user's device.

## Start simple and progressively

The easiest thing to do is simply ask the user for a pre-recorded
file. Do this by creating a simple file input element and adding
an `accept` filter that indicates we can only accept video files and ideally we
will get them directly from the camera.

    <input type="file" accept="video/*" capture="camera">

This method works on all platforms. On desktop it will prompt the user to
upload a file from the file system (ignoring `capture="camera"`). In Safari
on iOS it will open up the camera app, allowing you to record video and
then send it back to the web page; on Android it will give the user the
choice of which app to use record the video in before sending it back to the web
page.

Once the user has finished recording and they are back in the website, you
need to somehow get ahold of the file data. You can get quick access by
attaching an `onchange` event to the input element and then reading
the `files` property of the event object.

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;input type="file" accept="video/*" capture="camera" id="recorder">
&lt;video id="player" controls>&lt;/video>
&lt;script>
  var recorder = document.getElementById('recorder');
  var player = document.getElementById('player')'

  recorder.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
    var file = e.target.files[0];
    // Do something with the video file.
    player.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
  });
&lt;/script>
</pre>

Once you have access to the file you can do anything you want with it. For
example, you can:

* Attach it directly to a `<video>` element so that you can play it
* Download it to the user's device
* Upload it to a server by attaching to an `XMLHttpRequest`
* Draw the frames into a canvas and apply filters to it

Whilst using the input element method of getting access to video data is
ubiquitous, it is the least appealing option. We really want to get access to
the camera and provide a nice experience directly in the page.

## Access the camera interactively

Modern browsers can have a direct line to the camera allowing us to build
experiences that are fully integrated with the web page and the user will never
leave the browser.

### Acquire access to the camera

We can directly access the camera by using an API in the WebRTC
specification called `getUserMedia()`. `getUserMedia()` will prompt the user for
access to their connected microphones and cameras.

If successful the API will return a `Stream` that will contain the data from
either the camera or the microphone, and we can then either attach it to
a `<video>` element or save it using the `MediaRecorder` API.

To get data from the camera we just set `video: true` in the constraints
object that is passed to the `getUserMedia()` API

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;video id="player" controls>&lt;/video>
&lt;script>
  var player = document.getElementById('player');

  var handleSuccess = function(stream) {
    player.srcObject = stream;
  };

  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })
      .then(handleSuccess)
&lt;/script>
</pre>

By itself, this isn't that useful. All we can do is take the video data and play
it back.

### Access the raw data from the camera

To access the raw video data from the camera you can draw each frame into a `<canvas>` and
manipulate the pixels directly. You can learn more about this in our article about
[applying real-time effects to images and video](/web/fundamentals/media/manipulating/live-effects).

### Save the data from the camera

The easiest way to save the data from the camera is to use the
`MediaRecorder` API.

The `MediaRecorder` API will take the stream created by `getUserMedia` and then
progressively save the data from the stream to you preferred destination.

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;a id="download">Download</a>
&lt;button id="stop">Stop</button>
&lt;script>
  let shouldStop = false;
  let stopped = false;
  const downloadLink = document.getElementById('download');
  const stopButton = document.getElementById('stop');

  stopButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    shouldStop = true;
  })

  var handleSuccess = function(stream) {
    const options = {mimeType: 'video/webm'};
    const recordedChunks = [];
    <strong>const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, options);

    mediaRecorder.addEventListener('dataavailable', function(e) {
      if (e.data.size > 0) {
        recordedChunks.push(e.data);
      }

      if(shouldStop === true && stopped === false) {
        mediaRecorder.stop();
        stopped = true;
      }
    });

    mediaRecorder.addEventListener('stop', function() {
      downloadLink.href = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob(recordedChunks));
      downloadLink.download = 'acetest.webm';
    });

    mediaRecorder.start();</strong>
  };

  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })
      .then(handleSuccess);

&lt;/script>
</pre>

In our case we are saving the data directly into an array that we can later turn
in to a `Blob` which can be then used to save to our Web Server or directly in
storage on the user's device.

## Ask permission to use camera responsibly

If the user has not previously granted your site access to the camera then
the instant that you call `getUserMedia` the browser will prompt the user to
grant your site permission to the camera.

User's hate getting prompted for access to powerful devices on their machine and
they will frequently block the request, or they will ignore it if they don't
understand the context of which the prompt has been created. It is best practice
to only ask to access the camera when first needed. Once the user has
granted access they won't be asked again, however, if they reject access,
you can't get access again to ask the user for permission.

Warning: Asking for access to the camera on page load will result in most of your users rejecting
access.

### Use the permissions API to check if you already have access

The `getUserMedia` API provides you with no knowledge of if you already have
access to the camera. This presents you with a problem, to provide a nice UI
to get the user to grant you access to the camera, you have to ask for
access to camera.

This can be solved in some browsers by using the Permission API. The
`navigator.permission` API allows you to query the state of the ability to
access specific API's without having to prompt again.

To query if you have access to the user's camera you can pass in
`{name: 'camera'}` into the query method and it will return either:

*  `granted` &mdash; the user has previously given you access to the camera;
*  `prompt` &mdash; the user has not given you access and will be prompted when
    you call `getUserMedia`;
*  `denied` &mdash; the system or the user has explicitly blocked access to the
    camera and you won't be able to get access to it.

And you can now check quickly check to see if you need to alter your user
interface to accommodate the actions that the user needs to take.

    navigator.permissions.query({name:'camera'}).then(function(result) {
      if (result.state == 'granted') {

      } else if (result.state == 'prompt') {

      } else if (result.state == 'denied') {

      }
      result.onchange = function() {

      };
    });
