# The Offline Cookbook {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/jakearchibald.html" %}

When AppCache arrived on the scene it gave us a couple of patterns to make
content work offline. If those were the patterns you needed, congratulations,
you won the AppCache lottery (the jackpot remains unclaimed), but the rest of
us were left huddled in a corner
[rocking back & forth](http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag).

With [ServiceWorker][sw_primer] we gave up trying to solve offline, and 
gave developers the moving parts to go solve it themselves. It gives you 
control over caching and how requests are handled. That means you get to
create your own patterns. Let's take a look at a few possible patterns in
isolation, but in practice you'll likely use many of them in tandem
depending on URL & context.

All code examples work today in Chrome & Firefox, unless otherwise noted.
For full details on service worker support, see ["Is Service Worker Ready?"][is_sw_ready].

For a working demo of some of these patterns, see [Trained-to-thrill][ttt], 
and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px-J9Ghvcx4) 
showing the performance impact.

## The cache machine - when to store resources

[ServiceWorker][sw_primer] lets you handle requests independently from
caching, so we'll look at them separately. First up, caching, when should
it be done?

### On install - as a dependency {: #on-install-as-dependency }

<img src="images/cm-on-install-dep.png">

ServiceWorker gives you an `install` event. You can use this to get stuff
ready, stuff that must be ready before you handle other events. While this
happens any previous version of your ServiceWorker is still running &
serving pages, so the things you do here mustn't disrupt that.

**Ideal for:** CSS, images, fonts, JS, templates… basically anything you'd
consider static to that "version" of your site.

These are things that would make your site entirely non-functional if they
failed to fetch, things an equivalent native-app would make part of the
initial download.

    self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
      event.waitUntil(
        caches.open('mysite-static-v3').then(function(cache) {
          return cache.addAll([
            '/css/whatever-v3.css',
            '/css/imgs/sprites-v6.png',
            '/css/fonts/whatever-v8.woff',
            '/js/all-min-v4.js'
            // etc
          ]);
        })
      );
    });

`event.waitUntil` takes a promise to define the length & success of the 
install. If the promise rejects, the installation is considered a failure
and this ServiceWorker will be abandoned (if an older version is
running, it'll be left intact). `caches.open` and `cache.addAll` return 
promises. If any of the resources fail to fetch, the `cache.addAll` call
rejects.

On [trained-to-thrill][ttt] I use this to
[cache static assets](https://github.com/jakearchibald/trained-to-thrill/blob/3291dd40923346e3cc9c83ae527004d502e0464f/www/static/js-unmin/sw/index.js#L3).


### On install - not as a dependency {: #on-install-not }

<img src="images/cm-on-install-not.png">

Similar to above, but won't delay install completing and won't cause
installation to fail if caching fails.

**Ideal for:** Bigger resources that aren't needed straight away, such as
assets for later levels of a game.

    self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
      event.waitUntil(
        caches.open('mygame-core-v1').then(function(cache) {
          cache.addAll(
            // levels 11-20
          );
          return cache.addAll(
            // core assets & levels 1-10
          );
        })
      );
    });

We're not passing the `cache.addAll` promise for levels 11-20 back to 
`event.waitUntil`, so even if it fails, the game will still be available 
offline. Of course, you'll have to cater for the possible absence of those
levels & reattempt caching them if they're missing.

The ServiceWorker may be killed while levels 11-20 download since it's
finished handling events, meaning they won't be cached. In future we plan
to add a background downloading API to handle cases like this, and larger
downloads such as movies.

### On activate {: #on-activate }

<img src="images/cm-on-activate.png">

**Ideal for:** Clean-up & migration.

Once a new ServiceWorker has installed & a previous version isn't being used,
the new one activates, and you get an `activate` event. Because the old
version is out of the way, it's a good time to handle schema migrations in
IndexedDB and also delete unused caches.

    self.addEventListener('activate', function(event) {
      event.waitUntil(
        caches.keys().then(function(cacheNames) {
          return Promise.all(
            cacheNames.filter(function(cacheName) {
              // Return true if you want to remove this cache,
              // but remember that caches are shared across
              // the whole origin
            }).map(function(cacheName) {
              return caches.delete(cacheName);
            })
          );
        })
      );
    });

During activation, other events such as `fetch` are put into a queue, so a
long activation could potentially block page loads. Keep your activation
as lean as possible, only use it for things you _couldn't_ do while the old
version was active.

On [trained-to-thrill][ttt] I use this to 
[remove old caches](https://github.com/jakearchibald/trained-to-thrill/blob/3291dd40923346e3cc9c83ae527004d502e0464f/www/static/js-unmin/sw/index.js#L17).

### On user interaction {: #on-user-interaction }

<img src="images/cm-on-user-interaction.png">

**Ideal for:** If the whole site can't be taken offline, you may allow the
user to select the content they want available offline. E.g. a video on
something like YouTube, an article on Wikipedia, a particular gallery on Flickr.

Give the user a "Read later" or "Save for offline" button. When it's
clicked, fetch what you need from the network & pop it in the cache.

    document.querySelector('.cache-article').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      var id = this.dataset.articleId;
      caches.open('mysite-article-' + id).then(function(cache) {
        fetch('/get-article-urls?id=' + id).then(function(response) {
          // /get-article-urls returns a JSON-encoded array of
          // resource URLs that a given article depends on
          return response.json();
        }).then(function(urls) {
          cache.addAll(urls);
        });
      });
    });

The [caches API][caches_api] is available from pages as well as service
workers, meaning you don't need to involve the service worker to add things
to the cache.


### On network response {: #on-network-response }

<img src="images/cm-on-network-response.png">

**Ideal for:** Frequently updating resources such as a user's inbox, or
article contents. Also useful for non-essential content such as avatars,
but care is needed.

If a request doesn't match anything in the cache, get it from the network,
send it to the page & add it to the cache at the same time.

If you do this for a range of URLs, such as avatars, you'll need to be
careful you don't bloat the storage of your origin — if the user needs to
reclaim disk space you don't want to be the prime candidate. Make sure you
get rid of items in the cache you don't need any more.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        caches.open('mysite-dynamic').then(function(cache) {
          return cache.match(event.request).then(function (response) {
            return response || fetch(event.request).then(function(response) {
              cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
              return response;
            });
          });
        })
      );
    });

To allow for efficient memory usage, you can only read a response/request's
body once. In the code above, 
[`.clone()`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-request-clone) is used to
create additional copies that can be read separately.

On [trained-to-thrill][ttt] I use this to
[cache Flickr images](https://github.com/jakearchibald/trained-to-thrill/blob/3291dd40923346e3cc9c83ae527004d502e0464f/www/static/js-unmin/sw/index.js#L109).

### Stale-while-revalidate {: #stale-while-revalidate }

<img src="images/cm-stale-while-revalidate.png">

**Ideal for:** Frequently updating resources where having the very latest
version is non-essential. Avatars can fall into this category.

If there's a cached version available, use it, but fetch an update for
next time.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        caches.open('mysite-dynamic').then(function(cache) {
          return cache.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
            var fetchPromise = fetch(event.request).then(function(networkResponse) {
              cache.put(event.request, networkResponse.clone());
              return networkResponse;
            })
            return response || fetchPromise;
          })
        })
      );
    });

This is very similar to HTTP's
[stale-while-revalidate](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2007/12/12/stale).

### On push message {: #on-push-message }

<img src="images/cm-on-push.png">

The [Push API](/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/push-notifications/)
is another feature built on top of ServiceWorker. This allows the
ServiceWorker to be awoken in response to a message from the OS's
messaging service. This happens even when the user doesn't have a tab open to
your site, only the ServiceWorker is woken up. You request permission to do
this from a page & the user will be prompted.

**Ideal for:** Content relating to a notification, such as a chat
message, a breaking news story, or an email. Also infrequently changing
content that benefits from immediate sync, such as a todo list update
or a calendar alteration.

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <iframe class="devsite-embedded-youtube-video" data-video-id="0i7YdSEQI1w"
          data-autohide="1" data-showinfo="0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

The common final outcome is a notification which, when tapped,
opens/focuses a relevant page, but updating caches before this happens is
_extremely_ important. The user is obviously online at the time of receiving
the push message, but they may not be when they finally interact with the
notification, so making this content available offline is important. The
Twitter native app, which is for the most part an excellent example of
offline-first, gets this a bit wrong.

Without a connection, Twitter fails to provide the content relating to the
push message. Tapping it does remove the notification however, leaving the
user with less information than before they tapped. Don't do this!

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

This code updates caches before showing a notification:

    self.addEventListener('push', function(event) {
      if (event.data.text() == 'new-email') {
        event.waitUntil(
          caches.open('mysite-dynamic').then(function(cache) {
            return fetch('/inbox.json').then(function(response) {
              cache.put('/inbox.json', response.clone());
              return response.json();
            });
          }).then(function(emails) {
            registration.showNotification("New email", {
              body: "From " + emails[0].from.name
              tag: "new-email"
            });
          })
        );
      }
    });

    self.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {
      if (event.notification.tag == 'new-email') {
        // Assume that all of the resources needed to render
        // /inbox/ have previously been cached, e.g. as part
        // of the install handler.
        new WindowClient('/inbox/');
      }
    });


### On background-sync {: #on-background-sync }

<img src="images/cm-on-bg-sync.png">

[Background sync](/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync)
is another feature built on top of
ServiceWorker. It allows you to request background data synchronisation
as a one-off, or on an (extremely heuristic) interval. This happens even
when the user doesn't have a tab open to your site, only the ServiceWorker
is woken up. You request permission to do this from a page & the user will
be prompted.

**Ideal for:** Non-urgent updates, especially those that happen so regularly
that a push message per update would be too frequent, such as social
timelines or news articles.

    self.addEventListener('sync', function(event) {
      if (event.id == 'update-leaderboard') {
        event.waitUntil(
          caches.open('mygame-dynamic').then(function(cache) {
            return cache.add('/leaderboard.json');
          })
        );
      }
    });


## Cache persistence {: #cache-persistence }

Your origin is given a certain amount of free space to do what it wants with.
That free space is shared between all origin storage: LocalStorage,
IndexedDB, Filesystem, and of course Caches.

The amount you get isn't spec'd, it will differ depending on device and
storage conditions. You can find out how much you've got via:

    navigator.storageQuota.queryInfo("temporary").then(function(info) {
      console.log(info.quota);
      // Result: <quota in bytes>
      console.log(info.usage);
      // Result: <used data in bytes>
    });

However, like all browser storage, the browser is free to throw it away
if the device becomes under storage pressure. Unfortunately the browser
can't tell the different between those movies you want to keep at all
costs, and the game you don't really care about.

To work around this, there's a proposed API,
[`requestPersistent`](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/){: .external }:

    // From a page:
    navigator.storage.requestPersistent().then(function(granted) {
      if (granted) {
        // Hurrah, your data is here to stay!
      }
    });

Of course, the user has to grant permission. Making the user part of this
flow is important, as we can now expect them to be in control of deletion.
If their device comes under storage pressure, and clearing non-essential
data doesn't solve it, the user gets to make a judgement call on which items
to keep and remove.

For this to work, it requires operating systems to treat "durable" origins
as equivalent to native apps in their breakdowns of storage usage, rather
than reporting the browser as a single item.


## Serving Suggestions - responding to requests {: #serving-suggestions }

It doesn't matter how much caching you do, the ServiceWorker won't use the
cache unless you tell it when & how. Here are a few patterns for
handling requests:

### Cache only {: #cache-only }

<img src="images/ss-cache-only.png">

**Ideal for:** Anything you'd consider static to that "version" of your site.
You should have cached these in the install event, so you can depend on them
being there.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      // If a match isn't found in the cache, the response
      // will look like a connection error
      event.respondWith(caches.match(event.request));
    });

…although you don't often need to handle this case specifically,
[Cache, falling back to network](#cache-falling-back-to-network) covers it.

### Network only {: #network-only }

<img src="images/ss-network-only.png">

**Ideal for:** Things that have no offline equivalent, such as analytics
pings, non-GET requests.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(fetch(event.request));
      // or simply don't call event.respondWith, which
      // will result in default browser behaviour
    });

…although you don't often need to handle this case specifically, 
[Cache, falling back to network](#cache-falling-back-to-network) covers it.

### Cache, falling back to network {: #cache-falling-back-to-network }

<img src="images/ss-falling-back-to-network.png">

**Ideal for:** If you're building offline-first, this is how you'll handle
the majority of requests. Other patterns will be exceptions based on the
incoming request.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
          return response || fetch(event.request);
        })
      );
    });

This gives you the "Cache only" behaviour for things in the cache and the
"Network only" behaviour for anything not-cached (which includes all non-GET
requests, as they cannot be cached).

### Cache & network race {: #cache-and-network-race }

<img src="images/ss-cache-and-network-race.png">

**Ideal for:** Small assets where you're chasing performance on devices with
slow disk access.

With some combinations of older hard drives, virus scanners, and faster
internet connections, getting resources from the network can be quicker than
going to disk. However, going to the network when the user has the content on
their device can be a waste of data, so bear that in mind.

    // Promise.race is no good to us because it rejects if
    // a promise rejects before fulfilling. Let's make a proper
    // race function:
    function promiseAny(promises) {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // make sure promises are all promises
        promises = promises.map(p => Promise.resolve(p));
        // resolve this promise as soon as one resolves
        promises.forEach(p => p.then(resolve));
        // reject if all promises reject
        promises.reduce((a, b) => a.catch(() => b))
          .catch(() => reject(Error("All failed")));
      });
    };

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        promiseAny([
          caches.match(event.request),
          fetch(event.request)
        ])
      );
    });


### Network falling back to cache {: #network-falling-back-to-cache }

<img src="images/ss-network-falling-back-to-cache.png">

**Ideal for:** A quick-fix for resources that update frequently, outside of
the "version" of the site. E.g. articles, avatars, social media timelines,
game leader boards.

This means you give online users the most up-to-date content, but offline
users get an older cached version. If the network request succeeds you'll
most-likely want to [update the cache entry](#on-network-response).

However, this method has flaws. If the user has an intermittent or slow
connection they'll have to wait for the network to fail before they get the
perfectly acceptable content already on their device. This can take an
extremely long time and is a frustrating user experience. See the next
pattern, [Cache then network](#cache-then-network), for a better solution.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        fetch(event.request).catch(function() {
          return caches.match(event.request);
        })
      );
    });

### Cache then network {: #cache-then-network }

<img src="images/ss-cache-then-network.png">

**Ideal for:** Content that updates frequently. E.g. articles, social media
timelines, game leaderboards.

This requires the page to make two requests, one to the cache, one to the
network. The idea is to show the cached data first, then update the page
when/if the network data arrives.

Sometimes you can just replace the current data when new data arrives
(e.g. game leaderboard), but that can be disruptive with larger pieces of
content. Basically, don't "disappear" something the user may be reading or
interacting with.

Twitter adds the new content above the old content & adjusts the scroll
position so the user is uninterrupted. This is possible because Twitter
mostly retains a mostly-linear order to content. I copied this pattern for
[trained-to-thrill][ttt] to get content on screen as fast as
possible, but still display up-to-date content once it arrives.

**Code in the page:**

    var networkDataReceived = false;

    startSpinner();

    // fetch fresh data
    var networkUpdate = fetch('/data.json').then(function(response) {
      return response.json();
    }).then(function(data) {
      networkDataReceived = true;
      updatePage();
    });

    // fetch cached data
    caches.match('/data.json').then(function(response) {
      if (!response) throw Error("No data");
      return response.json();
    }).then(function(data) {
      // don't overwrite newer network data
      if (!networkDataReceived) {
        updatePage(data);
      }
    }).catch(function() {
      // we didn't get cached data, the network is our last hope:
      return networkUpdate;
    }).catch(showErrorMessage).then(stopSpinner);


**Code in the ServiceWorker:**

We always go to the network & update a cache as we go.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        caches.open('mysite-dynamic').then(function(cache) {
          return fetch(event.request).then(function(response) {
            cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
            return response;
          });
        })
      );
    });

Note: The above doesn't work in Chrome yet, as we've yet to expose `fetch` and `caches` to pages ([ticket #1](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=436770), [ticket #2](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=439389)).

In [trained-to-thrill][ttt] I worked around this by
using [XHR instead of fetch](https://github.com/jakearchibald/trained-to-thrill/blob/3291dd40923346e3cc9c83ae527004d502e0464f/www/static/js-unmin/utils.js#L3),
and abusing the Accept header to tell the ServiceWorker where to get the 
result from ([page code](https://github.com/jakearchibald/trained-to-thrill/blob/3291dd40923346e3cc9c83ae527004d502e0464f/www/static/js-unmin/index.js#L70),
[ServiceWorker code](https://github.com/jakearchibald/trained-to-thrill/blob/3291dd40923346e3cc9c83ae527004d502e0464f/www/static/js-unmin/sw/index.js#L61)).

### Generic fallback {: #generic-fallback }

<img src="images/ss-generic-fallback.png">

If you fail to serve something from the cache and/or network you may want
to provide a generic fallback.

**Ideal for:** Secondary imagery such as avatars, failed POST requests,
"Unavailable while offline" page.

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      event.respondWith(
        // Try the cache
        caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
          // Fall back to network
          return response || fetch(event.request);
        }).catch(function() {
          // If both fail, show a generic fallback:
          return caches.match('/offline.html');
          // However, in reality you'd have many different
          // fallbacks, depending on URL & headers.
          // Eg, a fallback silhouette image for avatars.
        })
      );
    });

The item you fallback to is likely to be an [install dependency](#on-install-as-dependency).

If your page is posting an email, your ServiceWorker may fall back to
storing the email in an IDB 'outbox' & respond letting the page know that
the send failed but the data was successfully retained.

### ServiceWorker-side templating {: #serviceworker-side-templating }

<img src="images/ss-sw-side-templating.png">

**Ideal for:** Pages that cannot have their server response cached.

[Rendering pages on the server makes things fast](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-is-faster/),
but that can mean including state data that may not make sense in a cache,
e.g. "Logged in as…". If your page is controlled by a ServiceWorker,
you may instead choose to request JSON data along with a template,
and render that instead.

    importScripts('templating-engine.js');

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      var requestURL = new URL(event.request);

      event.respondWith(
        Promise.all([
          caches.match('/article-template.html').then(function(response) {
            return response.text();
          }),
          caches.match(requestURL.path + '.json').then(function(response) {
            return response.json();
          })
        ]).then(function(responses) {
          var template = responses[0];
          var data = responses[1];

          return new Response(renderTemplate(template, data), {
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'text/html'
            }
          });
        })
      );
    });


## Putting it together

You don't have to pick one of these methods, you'll likely use many of
them depending on request URL. For example,
[trained-to-thrill][ttt] uses:

* [Cache on install](#on-install-as-dependency), for the static UI and behaviour
* [Cache on network response](#on-network-response), for the Flickr images and data
* [Fetch from cache, falling back to network](#cache-falling-back-to-network), for most requests
* [Fetch from cache, then network](#cache-then-network), for the Flickr search results

Just look at the request and decide what to do:

    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
      // Parse the URL:
      var requestURL = new URL(event.request.url);

      // Handle requests to a particular host specifically
      if (requestURL.hostname == 'api.example.com') {
        event.respondWith(/* some combination of patterns */);
        return;
      }
      // Routing for local URLs
      if (requestURL.origin == location.origin) {
        // Handle article URLs
        if (/^\/article\//.test(requestURL.pathname)) {
          event.respondWith(/* some other combination of patterns */);
          return;
        }
        if (/\.webp$/.test(requestURL.pathname)) {
          event.respondWith(/* some other combination of patterns */);
          return;
        }
        if (request.method == 'POST') {
          event.respondWith(/* some other combination of patterns */);
          return;
        }
        if (/cheese/.test(requestURL.pathname)) {
          event.respondWith(
            new Response("Flagrant cheese error", {
              status: 512
            })
          );
          return;
        }
      }

      // A sensible default pattern
      event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
          return response || fetch(event.request);
        })
      );
    });

…you get the picture.
