Internet connections can be flakey or non-existent on the go, which is why
offline support and reliable performance are common features in [progressive
web apps](/web/progressive-web-apps/). Even in
perfect wireless environments, judicious use of caching and other storage
techniques can substantially improve the user experience. In this post, we’ll
summarize some ideas around offline data storage for PWAs — think JSON
payloads, images and general static data required to provide a *meaningful*
experience offline.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## Recommendation

Let’s get right to the point with a general recommendation for storing data
offline:

* For the network resources necessary to load your app while offline, use the [**Cache API**](cache-api)
  (part of [service workers](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-worker/)).
* For all other data, use [**IndexedDB**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
  (with a [promises wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb)).

Here’s the rationale:

Both APIs are asynchronous (IndexedDB is event based and the Cache API is
Promise based). They also work with [web workers, window and service
workers](https://nolanlawson.github.io/html5workertest/). IndexedDB is
available [everywhere](http://caniuse.com/#feat=indexeddb). Service
Workers (and the Cache API) are
[now available](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/) in Chrome,
Firefox, Opera and are in development for Edge. Promise wrappers for
IndexedDB hide some of the powerful but also complex machinery
(e.g. transactions, schema versioning) that comes with the IndexedDB
library. IndexedDB will support
[observers](https://github.com/WICG/indexed-db-observers), which allow easy
synchronization between tabs.

Safari 10 has
[fixed many long-standing IndexedDB bugs](https://gist.github.com/nolanlawson/08eb857c6b17a30c1b26)
in their latest Tech Previews. NOTE:  Some folks have run into stability
issues with Safari 10’s IndexedDB and PouchDB and have found it to be a
little slow. Until more research has been done here, your mileage may vary.
Please do test and file browser bugs so the folks @webkit and related OSS
library authors can take a look. LocalForage, PouchDB, YDN and Lovefield
use WebSQL in Safari by default (due to lack of an efficient way to
feature-test for broken IndexedDB). This means these libraries will work
in Safari 10 without extra effort (just not using IndexedDB directly).

For PWAs, you can cache static resources, composing your application shell
(JS/CSS/HTML files) using the Cache API and fill in the offline page data from
IndexedDB. Debugging support for IndexedDB is now available in
[Chrome](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/manage-data/local-storage)
(Application tab),
Opera, [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector)
(Storage Inspector) and Safari (see the Storage tab).

## What about other storage mechanisms?

Web Storage (e.g LocalStorage and SessionStorage) is synchronous, has no Web
Worker support and is size and type (strings only) limited. Cookies [have their
uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) but are
synchronous, lack web worker support and are also size-limited.
WebSQL does not have broad browser support and its use is not recommended.
The File System API is not supported on any browser besides Chrome. The
[File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) is
being improved in the
[File and Directory Entries API](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/)
and [File API](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/) specs but neither is
sufficiently mature or standardized to encourage widespread adoption yet.

## How much can I store?

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Browser</th>
    <th>Limit</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Chrome</td>
      <td>&lt;6% of free space</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Firefox</td>
      <td>&lt;10% of free space</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Safari</td>
      <td>&lt;50MB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>IE10</td>
      <td>&lt;250MB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edge</td>
      <td>
        <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/dev-guide/storage/IndexedDB/">
          Dependent on volume size
        </a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  <tbody>
</table>

In Chrome and Opera, your storage is per origin (rather than per API). Both
storage mechanisms will store data until the browser
[quota](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/offline/quota-research/) is
reached. Apps can check how much quota they’re using with the [Quota Management
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StorageQuota). In Chrome,
apps can use up to 6% of free
disk space. In Firefox, apps can use up to 10% of free disk space, but will
prompt the user for further storage requests after 50MB data stored. In mobile
Safari, apps can use up to 50MB max, whereas desktop Safari allows unlimited
storage (and prompts after 5MB). IE10+ maxes out at 250MB and prompts the user
at 10MB. PouchDB [tracks](https://pouchdb.com/faq.html#data_limits) IDB storage
behavior.

## How can I tell how much storage space my app is using?

In Chrome, the [Quota Management API](https://www.w3.org/TR/quota-api/) lets
you query for the size of storage space currently used and how much is
available to the application. A newer [Storage Quota Estimate
API](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5630353511284736) tries to make it
even easier to discover how much quota an origin is using with support for
Promises.

## How does cache eviction work?

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Browser</th>
    <th>Eviction Policy</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Chrome</td>
      <td>LRU once Chrome runs out of space</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Firefox</td>
      <td>LRU if the whole disk gets full</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Safari</td>
      <td>No eviction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edge</td>
      <td>No eviction</td>
    </tr>
  <tbody>
</table>

An origin is given an amount of space to do with as it pleases. This free space
is shared across all forms of origin storage (IndexedDB, Cache API,
localStorage etc). The amount given isn’t specified and will vary depending on
device and storage conditions.

When web storage is low, a UA will clear storage to make space available. This
can harm offline responsiveness so the recently updated
[Storage](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/) spec defines "persistent", and
“best effort” strategies, with “best effort” being the default. “Best effort”
means the storage can be cleared without interrupting the user, but is less
durable for long-term and/or critical data. IndexedDB and the Cache API both
fall into the “best effort” category today.

"Persistent" storage is not automatically cleared when storage is low. The
user needs to manually clear this storage (via browser settings). Chrome has
been experimenting with support for [Persistent
Storage](/web/updates/2016/06/persistent-storage)
under an origin trial, and the latest news suggests it will be shipping in
[Chrome
55](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/5Sihi1iAXYc/wnvNDFIPAQAJ).

## Current and future offline storage work

If offline storage interests you, the efforts below are worth keeping an eye
on.

* [Durable Storage](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/): protect storage from
the user agent’s clearing policies.

* [Indexed Database API 2.0](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/): advanced
key-value data management.

* [Promisified
IndexedDB](https://github.com/inexorabletash/indexeddb-promises): native
support for a Promise-friendly version of IndexedDB.

* [IndexedDB Observers](https://github.com/WICG/indexed-db-observers): native
IndexedDB observation without needing wrapper around the database.

* [Async Cookies API](https://github.com/bsittler/async-cookies-api): async
JavaScript cookies API for documents and workers.

* [Quota Management API](https://www.w3.org/TR/quota-api/): check how much
quota an app/origin is using.

* [writable-files](https://github.com/WICG/writable-files): allow sites to
interact with local files more seamlessly.

* [Directory downloads](https://github.com/drufball/directory-download): allow
sites to download directories without .zip files.

* [File and Directory Entries API](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/):
support for file and directory upload by drag-and-drop.

* Support for an [Async Cookies
API](https://github.com/WICG/async-cookies-api) is being sketched out right now
with a polyfill in the works.

* Debugging IndexedDB is not currently supported in Edge (however, it is possible to
debug the underlying JetDB) — vote
[here](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6517763-indexeddb-explorer-in-dev-tools)
for built in support.

* Although [ideas](https://github.com/slightlyoff/async-local-storage) for
async LocalStorage have been kicked around in the past, current focus is on getting
[IndexedDB 2.0](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) in a good state.

* The [writable-files](https://github.com/WICG/writable-files) proposal may
eventually give us a better standards-track solution for seamless local file
interaction.

* For apps requiring more persistent storage, see the on-going work on
[Durable Storage](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/).

Offline storage isn’t quite magical and an understanding of the underlying APIs
will go far in helping you make the most out of what we now have available.
Whether you prefer to directly use these APIs or work with an abstraction
library, take some time to get familiar with your options.

Hopefully this guidance will help you craft an offline experience that makes your
PWA shine! ✨
