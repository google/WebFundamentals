## WebVR Implementation Status

### WebXR Device API {:#xrdevice}

* Using the WebXR device API requires a
[compatible device](/ar/discover/supported-devices)
running Android O or later, [ARCore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign)
, and of course, Chrome.
* The WebXR device API is available on other browsers with a
[polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill).
* Documentation is available from the [Immersive Web Early Adopters
Guide](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-reference/).

Today the API is available in:

| Feature | Chrome version | Details |
| ------- | -------------- | ------- |
| AR hit test support | Chrome Canary for the immediate future. | Enable the `#webxr` and `#webxr-hit-test` flags under chrome://flags. Note that VR magic windows do not work when the `#webxr-hit-test` flag is turned on. Please excuse our construction debri. |
| VR use cases | Chrome 66 and later | Enable the `chrome://flags/#webxr` flag. (The URL must be entered manually.). |
| VR use cases | Chrome 67 origin trial | Enable the `chrome://flags/#webxr` flag *and* sign up for the origin trial ([explainer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md), [sign-up form](http://bit.ly/OriginTrialSignup)). |

### Version 1.1 {:#version_1_1}

Note: This API is deprecated and its origin trial is scheduled to end in
July.

Today the WebVR 1.1 API is available in:

* Firefox Nightly.
* Samsung Internet for Android and for Gear VR.
* A Chrome [Origin
Trial](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md)
that ran from version 56 beta to June of 2017.

It's supported on:

 * Daydream View since M56
 * Google Cardboard since M57

It's also available through the [WebXR
Polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill).

## Considerations

Here are things to remember when building WebVR experiences today.

* **You must serve your WebVR content over HTTPS.** If you donâ€™t your users will
  get warnings from the browser. See [Enabling HTTPS on Your
  Servers](/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https)
  for more guidance.
* **The [WebXR Polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill) may not
  always be a 1:1 match with native implementations of the spec.** If you plan
  to use the Polyfill, be sure to check on both VR-capable and non-VR devices.
* **For some types of sessions, users must click a button before
  AR or VR are available to your code**. See the [Immersive Web Early Adopters
  Guide](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-reference/) for more information.
