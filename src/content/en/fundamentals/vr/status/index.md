## Considerations

Here are things to remember when building WebVR experiences today.

* **You must serve your WebVR content over HTTPS.** If you donâ€™t your users will
  get warnings from the browser. See [Enabling HTTPS on Your
  Servers](/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https)
  for more guidance.
* **The [WebXR Polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill) may not
  always be a 1:1 match with native implementations of the spec.** If you plan
  to use the Polyfill, be sure to check on both VR-capable and non-VR devices.
* **For some types of sessions, users must click a button before
  AR or VR are available to your code**. See the [Immersive Web Early Adopters
  Guide](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-reference/) for more information.
