## Provide a site-wide theme color

Chrome introduced the concept of a theme color for your site in 2014. The theme color
is a hint from your web page that tells the browser what color to tint
[UI elements such as the address bar](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/browser-customization/).  


<figure>
  <img src="images/theme-color.png" alt="backgroud color">
  <figcaption>Theme color</figcaption>
</figure>

Without a manifest, you have to define the theme color on every single page, and if 
you have a large site or legacy site, making a lot of site wide changes is not feasible.

Add in a `theme_color` attribute to your manifest, and when the site is launched
from the home screen every page in the domain will automatically get the theme color.

{% highlight json %}
"theme_color": "#2196F3"
{% endhighlight %}
