<p class="intro">
In 2015, <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/07/google-case-study-on-app-download-interstitials.html">a case study</a> found that when prompted to download and install Google+, 9% of users did so. 
That's an impressive click-through rate, or it would be if we were talking
about online ads. The same study found that 69% of users both left the page 
that prompted and ignored the invite to install Google+.
<br/><br/>
Push notifications and the technologies behind them improve retention odds by taking advantage of the code that's already on the user's device: your web page. If you're deploying a <a href="/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android">web app manifest</a>, or following the principles of <a href="/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell">application shell architecture</a> then your web pages are already more like native apps than are other web sites. Even if they're not using those technologies, you can retain more users by using push notifications more effectively.
