# Requesting Permission and Subscribing Users {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/josephmedley.html" %}

Requesting permission for and subscribing users to notifications requires as light a touch as showing them notifications.

In this section and the remaining section I'm going to show you actual code.
It's important to be clear about where these bits of code are implemented. This
is where understanding service workers becomes important. The code for
requesting permission and subscribing users in done in your app's code, rather
than the service worker code. The service worker will be used later when we
process push messages and display them to the user.

## Check permissions {: #check-permissions }

Always check for an existing permission when the page loads. If the permission
is already granted, you can start sending notifications
immediately. Either way, use this information to set the state of permission
settings. An example of this is shown below. To be clear, we're not asking for
anything yet.

Note: For the sake of clarity, this example excludes a number of feature checks
that you should always perform. You can view the original code in it's entirety
in our <a href='https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/push-messaging-and-notifications'>
GitHub samples repo</a>.


    function initialiseState() {
      if (Notification.permission !== 'granted') {
        console.log('The user has not granted the notification permission.');
        return;
      } else if (Notification.permission === “blocked”) {
       /* the user has previously denied push. Can't reprompt. */ 
      } else {
        /* show a prompt to the user */
      }
      
      // Use serviceWorker.ready so this is only invoked
      // when the service worker is available.
      navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(serviceWorkerRegistration) {
        serviceWorkerRegistration.pushManager.getSubscription()
          .then(function(subscription) {
            if (!subscription) {
              // Set appropriate app states.
              return;
            }
          })
          .catch(function(err) {
            console.log('Error during getSubscription()', err);
          });
      });
    }
    

## Avoid page-load subscription requests {: #avoid-page-load-requests }

Notice that the previous example does _not_ call 
`pushManager.subscribe()`, though this would seem the logical response to
finding that no existing subscription exists. Such requests may seem timely but, since you don't yet know anything about your users and they may not 
know anything about you, it's difficult to send them precise or relevant
messages.

## Requesting permission {: #requesting-permission }

<figure class="attempt-right">
  <img src="images/news-prompt.png" alt="First ask before sending notifications and explain why.">
</figure>

Regardless of when you do it, requesting permission is a two-step process.
First, ask whether your application can send notifications, using a message that
explains exactly why you want to send them notifications.

If the user approves, we need to send a subscription request to the push
manager. Do this by calling `PushManager.subscribe()` (emphasized in the example
below). In this example, we're passing it an object with `userVisibleOnly` set
to `true` so that all push messages sent to the client appear to the user as a
notification. In practice, this means that even if a user doesn't have your site
visible, a notification is still created. We're also including an
`applicationServerKey` converted to an integer array.


<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<pre class="prettyprint">
if ('showNotification' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype) {
  navigator.serviceworker.ready
  .then(registration => {
    if (!subscription) {
      <strong>return registration.pushManager.subscribe({
          userVisibleOnly: true,
          applicationServerKey: window.base64UrlToUint8Array(
            '3xt3rm1n8_totallyFakePublicKey_a10nZ13'
          );</strong>
    }
    return subscription;
  })
  .then(subscription => {
    // Do something with the subscription.
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Do something with the error.
  });
}
</pre>

This is the result in Chrome.

### What about the applicationServerKey? {#applicationserverkey}

You probably noticed that the call to `subscribe()` contains a parameter called
`applicationServerKey`. Its value is generated by your server. We were saving
all server side issue for the next section. For now, there's one thing you need
to know about the `applicationServerKey`: when passing in the key to a
`subscribe()` call, make sure it's a
[Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array)
(an array of eight-bit-unsigned integers).

## Trigger from a specific action {: #trigger-from-action }

<figure class="attempt-right">
  <img src="images/airline-prompt.png" alt="A prompt with a specific action.">
</figure>

Ask for permission to send notifications in response to a specific,
contextual user action. This allows you to tie your notifications
to a user's goal and makes it clear to the user why you want to send
notifications.

For example, If an airline site wanted to notify users of flight delays,
they would prominently display an opt-in checkbox and only ask for
notification permissions after the user chooses to opt in.

## Provide a place to manage notifications {: #manage-notifications }

Make it easy for users to change and even disable notifications for your site.
It prevents users from killing notifications at the browser or device level.

Add a notification switch in a place with high visibility. Also, label it to
show users what you want to send them, not how it's implemented. Users have no
more idea what a "push notification" is than you would know how to adjust the
orbit of a Soyuz capsule.

## Passing a subscription to the server {: #passing-subscription }

After getting a user's permission to send notifications and setting the state of
related controls, you need to send the subscription information (called the
"Push Resource" in the spec) to the push server. This involves creating an
appropriate request object containing the subscription data, then passing it to
the server.

When you create the request (emphasized in the example below), use the `POST`
verb and a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`. For the body you need
to convert the subscription object to a string. We'll look at what's in this
object in the next section, [Sending  Messages](sending-messages). Use `fetch()`
to send the subscription request to the server.

<pre class="prettyprint">
if ('showNotification' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype) {
  navigator.serviceworker.ready
  .then(registration => {
    if (!subscription) {
      return registration.pushManager.subscribe({
        userVisibleOnly: true,
        applicationServerKey: window.base64UrlToUint8Array(
          '3xt3rm1n8_totallyFakePublicKey_a10nZ13'
         );
      })
    }
    return subscription;
  })
  <strong>.then(subscription => {
    var fetchOptions = {
      method: 'post',
      headers: new Headers({
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }),
      body: JSON.stringify(subscription)</strong>
    };
    return fetch('/your-web-server/api', fetchOptions);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Do something with the error.
  });
}
</pre>
