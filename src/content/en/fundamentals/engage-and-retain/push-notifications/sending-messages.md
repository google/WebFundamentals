# Sending Messages {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/josephmedley.html" %}

There are actually two servers involved in sending a message: your server
and a third party messaging server. You keep track of two things:
recipients and recipient-specific endpoints on the messaging server. The
messaging server handles the routing.

## The broader context {: #the-broader-context }

We've seen how to subscribe to push within a web application. That process
included passing in a public key, called the `applicationServerKey`, into the
subscription API.

The following diagram shows the order of operations.

![Sending a message](images/push-flow.gif)

1. A device downloads your web app containing an already created publicKey,
   referred to in scripts as the `applicationServerKey`. Your web app installs
   a service worker.
1. During the subscription flow the browser contacts the messaging server to
   create a new subscription and returns it to the app.

    <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> You don't need to know the URL of the message server. Each browser vender manages it's own message server for its browser.</aside>

1. After the subscription flow, your app passes a subscription object back to
   your app server.
1. At some later point, your app server sends a message to the messaging
   server, which forwards it to the recipient.

## Generating the applicationServerKey {: #generating-the-key }

There are several things you need to know about the `applicationServerKey`:

* It's the public key portion of a public/private key pair generated on your
  application server.
* The key pair should be usable with an elliptic curve digital signature
  (ECDSA) over the P-256 curve.
* Your app should pass the public key to the messaging server as an array of
  eight-bit unsigned integers.
* It's defined in a spec called Voluntary Application Server Identification
  for Web Push (VAPID), which we'll discuss in the [sending messages](sending-messages) section.

You can find an example for generating this in the
[web-push node library](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push/). It looks
something like this:


    function generateVAPIDKeys() {
      var curve = crypto.createECDH('prime256v1');
      curve.generateKeys();

      return {
        publicKey: curve.getPublicKey(),
        privateKey: curve.getPrivateKey(),
      };
    }


## Anatomy of a subscription object {: #subscription-anatomy }

Earlier we said that a subscription object must be stringified and passed to the
server, but we didn't tell you what was in the subscription object. That's
because the client doesn't do anything with it. The server does.  

The subscription object looks like this:  


    {  
      "endpoint": "https://example.com/push-service/send/dbDqU8xX10w:APA91b...",  
      "keys": {  
        "auth": "qLAYRzG9TnUwbprns6H2Ew==",  
        "p256dh": "BILXd-c1-zuEQYXH\\_tc3qmLq52cggfqqTr\\_ZclwqYl6A7-RX2J0NG3icsw..."  
      }  
    }


What's in this?  

**endpoint**—Contains two parts: the URL of the messaging service used by the
subscribing browser followed by unique identifier for the user.

**keys**—Encryption keys used for encrypting data passed to the service worker
messages. It contains the following:

* **auth**-A 16 byte authentication secret generated by the browser.
* **p256dh**-65 bytes containing a public key from the push service that
  developers need to use when encryption messages they want to send to that
  push service.

Note: In many of the relevant specs bytes are called octets. The term is used because of legacy and communication systems where bytes may not always be 8 bits long.

## Creating the message {: #creating-the-message }

This is where things start to get a little crazy. In this section we're no
longer in your client app. We're on the app server where we are going to create
and send a message to the client. There's much to keep track of.

Before continuing, let's review what we have and where it came from.

* **Subscription object** - This came from the client. It contains the endpoint
  of the messaging server, a copy of the public key, and an authentication
  secret generated by the client. From here on, we're going to stop talking
  about the subscription object and only refer to the **endpoint**, **public
  key**, and **authentication secret**.
* **private key** - The VAPID private key corresponding to the VAPID public key.
  This is a private key for your application server.

We're going to look at message creation in three parts. First we'll create some
HTTP headers, then we'll create a payload for the message, and finally we'll
combine them and send them to the messaging server.

The code samples given in this section, which are taken from the [web-push node
library](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push).

### The product {: #the-product }

Let's look at what we're going to end up with, then we'll talk about how to
build it.

<pre class="prettyprint">POST /push-service/send/dbDqU8xX10w:APA91b... HTTP/1.1  
Host: push.example.net  
Push-Receipt: https://push.example.net/r/3ZtI4YVNBnUUZhuoChl6omU  
TTL: 43200  
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf8

Crypto-Key:
p256ecdsa=BA1Hxzyi1RUM1b5wjxsn7nGxAszw2u61m164i3MrAIxHF6YK5h4SDYic-dRuU\_RCPCfA5aq9ojSwk5Y2EmClBPsiChYuI3jMzt3ir20P8r\_jgRR-dSuN182x7iB</pre>

Notice that this request is sent to the endpoint contained in the subscription
object. The Authorization, Crypto-Key , and TTL headers take a little
explanation. Let's start with the simplest.

## HTTP headers {: #http-headers }

### TTL {: #ttl }

It may be some time before a message server can deliver a message sent by your
app server. Message services aren't obligated to hold a message forever.
Frankly, to be timely, an app server should never send a message that can live
forever. That's why it's required to include a header called TTL, literally
'time to live'.

The TTL header is a a value in seconds given as a suggestion to the message
server for how long the server should keep the message and attempt to deliver
it. If it chooses, the message server may shorten the time it is willing to keep
the message. If it does, it must return that shortened time in a TTL header in a
response to the message request. If the TTL has a value of 0, the message server
should deliver it immediately if the user agent is available. If the user agent
isn't available the message expires immediately and is never delivered.

### Crypto-Key header {: #crypto-key-header }

To validate a message sent by your app server, the message server needs the
public key. You send the public key in the Crypto-Key header. The Crypto-Key
header has several parts.  

<pre class="prettyprint">dh=<i>applicationServerKey</i>,p256ecdsa=<i>publicKey</i></pre>  

For example:  

<pre class="prettyprint">dh=BGEw2wsHgLwzerjvnMTkbKrFRxdmwJ5S\_k7zi7A1coR\_sVjHmGrlvzYpAT1n4NPbioFlQkIrT  
NL8EH4V3ZZ4vJE,p256ecdsa=BDd3\_hVL9fZi9Ybo2UUzA284WG5FZR30\_95YeZJsiApwXKpNcF1rRPF3foIiBHXRdJI2Qhumhf6\_LFTeZaN</pre>

The first part (`dh=applicationServerKey`) is the public key, the one we created
under Requesting permission and subscribing users. The second part
(`p256ecdsa=publicKey`) is the public key. Both must be base64 url encoded.
Notice the  comma separating the two parts of the Crypto-Key.

Note: A bug in Chrome 52 requires that a semicolor be used to separate the parts of the Cyrpto-Key, instead of a comma.

### Authorization header {: #authorization-header }

To send messages, you need an an Authorization header. It contains four parts:  

<pre class="prettyprint">WebPush &lt;JWTHeader&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;.&lt;Signature&gt;</pre>

The word WebPush is a literal that must be followed by a space. The remaining
portions, which are encrypted and concatenated using a period form a signed JSON
web token (JWT). A JWT is a way of sharing a JSON object with a second party in
such a way that the sending party can sign it and the receiving party can verify
the signature is from the expected sender.   

Let's look at each part of the token in detail.

#### JWT Header {: #jwt-header }

The JWT Header contains two standard pieces of information: a `typ` property to
indicate that the type of message, in this case, a JWT message, and an `alg`
property to indicate the algorithm used for signing the the message.
These details should then be base64 url encoded.


    {  
      "typ": "JWT",  
      "alg": "ES256"  
    }


#### JWT Payload {: #jwt-payload }

The JWT calls this section the payload. This isn't where the message payload is
stored. We'll get to that shortly. The payload is another JSON object with the
following members:    
**aud**  
This contains the origin of the push service endpoint, which you should extract
from the subscription object. This is not the origin of your site.    
**exp**  
Specifies the time the JWT request expires in milliseconds (not the expiration
of the message itself). It must be within twenty-four hours. This can be
calculated by converting the current date to milliseconds and adding the duration.
For example, in Node.js you could do this:


    Math.floor((Date.now() / 1000) + 12 * 60 * 60)


**sub**  
Specifies a subject, which the VAPID spec defines as a way for the push service
to contact a message sender. This can be a URL or a mailto address (see the
example below).  

A complete JWT payload looks like this:


    {  
      "aud": "http://push.example.net",  
      "exp": "1469618703",  
      "sub": "mailto: my-email@some-url.com"  
    }


#### Signature {: #signature }

The signature is the last section of the JWT.

<pre class="prettyprint">WebPush &lt;JWTHeader&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;.&lt;Signature&gt;</pre>

Create the signature by first concatenating the JWT header and the payload with
a dot. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;JWTHeader&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;</pre>

Encrypt this using the private key you created in
[Generating the applicationServerKey](generating-the-applicationserverkey).

You now have all three pieces that form the JWT which you join to together
with a dot.

<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;JWTHeader&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;.&lt;Signature&gt;</pre>

We're not going to show you how to do the signature encryption, but there
are a number of libraries available. A good place to look is the libraries section of
[jwt.io](https://jwt.io/){: .external }.

Finally, prepend the word 'WebPush' followed by a space. The result will look
something like the following:

<pre class="prettyprint">WebPush eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2ZjbS5nb29nbGVhcGlzLmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTQ2NjY2ODU5NCwic3ViIjoibWFpbHRvOnNpbXBsZS1wdXNoLWRlbW9AZ2F1bnRmYWNlLmNvLnVrIn0.Ec0VR8dtf5qb8Fb5Wk91br-evfho9sZT6jBRuQwxVMFyK5S8bhOjk8kuxvilLqTBmDXJM5l3uVrVOQirSsjq0A</pre>

### Message payload {: #message-payload }

When implementing server code there are two methods of sending messages to
consider.

* Messages with a data payload.
* Messages without a data payload, often called a tickle.

In the case of the tickle, the service worker uses the message as a signal to
fetch data from an endpoint. The Handling Messages section contains sample code
for showing how a service worker does this.

Why would you ever send a message without a payload? There are two reasons.

* You need to send something larger than the 4k payload limit set by the spec
* The clients needs fresher data than what would be in the push.

Technically, there's another reason which is that browser capabilities may vary
for a while yet, but the two main reasons will likely always apply. If the
browser doesn't support payloads, the subscription object won't contain keys.

The payload, regardless of how you get it to the client, must be encrypted.
Encryption is enough of a specialty, even within software development, that we
don't recommend writing your own encryption system. Fortunately, there are a
range of push libraries  available.

For payloads sent through the message server you must encrypt it using the
publicKey and the authentication secret. It must also be salted with 16 random
bytes that are unique to the message. Finally, it's added to the body of the
request sent to the message server.

### Sending it on its way {: #sending-it-on-its-way }

In the web-push node library this is accomplished with an instance of the
request object from the built-in https library.


    const https = require('https');


At some point the request is sent to the message server. The web-push node
library wraps this code inside a promise (with appropriate calls to resolve and
reject) so that it can happen asynchronously. The code example below, taken from
the [web-push node library](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push)
illustrates this.

Note that the message server responds to the network request immediately,
meaning it is asynchronous to sending the message to the client app.


    const pushRequest = https.request(options, function(pushResponse) {  
      let body = '';    
      // Allow the payload to be sent out in chunks.  
      pushResponse.on('data', function(chunk) {  
        body += chunk;  
      });    
      // Check to see if the push is successful.  
      pushResponse.on('end', function() {  
        if (pushResponse.statusCode !== 201) {  
          reject(new WebPushError('Received unexpected response code',  
            pushResponse.statusCode, pushResponse.headers, body));  
        } else {  
          // Do something with the response body.  
        }  
     });  
    });  

    if (requestPayload) {  
      pushRequest.write(requestPayload);  
    }  

    pushRequest.end();  

    pushRequest.on('error', function(e) {  
      console.error(e);  
    });
