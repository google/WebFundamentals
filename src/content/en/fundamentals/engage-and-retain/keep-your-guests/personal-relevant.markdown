<p class="intro">
  Here are a few tips for making your notifications personal and relevant.
</p>

## Make the Title Specific

Make the title relevant to the context of the message and include something
specific from the message.

**BAD:** Notifcation from facebook.com

**GOOD:** Paul Kinlan sent you a message

## Make the Content Specific to the Push Message

Look at the notifications on any of your devices. You're likely to find two types of messages: ones that tell you specific things and ones that are vague or opaque. For example, a social site might give you a notification like this:

![A notification that says nothing](images/better-notification.png){:width="380px"}

Notice that it tells you who sent it, even showing you the sender's picture, and gives you some idea what it's about.

This one on the other hand tells you nothing that would make you want to open the application.
