Components are the building blocks of modern web applications. What best
practices should you follow when building your own components so they can stand
the test of time?

<div class="attempt-left">
  <h2>Custom Elements</h2>
  <a href="/web/fundamentals/building-components/customelements">

    </div>
  </a>
  <p>
    Custom Elements give developers the ability to extend HTML and create their
    own tags. Because Custom Elements are standards based they benefit from the
    Web's built-in component model. The result is more modular code that can be
    reused in many different contexts. <a href="/web/fundamentals/building-components/customelements">Learn more</a>

  <h2>Shadow DOM</h2>
  <a href="/web/fundamentals/building-components/shadowdom">
    <div class="align-center">
      <img width="88" src="/web/images/md-icons/ic_border_style_black_24px.svg">
    </div>
  </a>
  <p>
    Shadow DOM is a web standard that offers component style and markup
    encapsulation. It is critically important piece in the Web Components story
    as it ensures that a component will work in any environment, regardless of
    what other CSS or JavaScript is at play on the page.

  <h2>Best practices</h2>

    </div>
  </a>
  <p>
    Because Custom Elements and Shadow DOM are low-level primitives, it's not
    always clear how best to combine them to create a component that is robust
    and works well in many different environments. While you really can do just
    about anything with these APIs, here are a few best practices to help ensure
    your components work well anywhere.

    HowTo-Components are a set of elements which demonstrate Custom Element
    and Shadow DOM best practices. These elements are not intended to be used
    in production, but are instead presented as a teaching aide to help map
    best practice suggestions to actual implementations.

    Because Web Components are a new set of standards, you may not be familiar
    with all of the terminology used. Learn the lingo so you can sling
    Web Components with the best of 'em.
