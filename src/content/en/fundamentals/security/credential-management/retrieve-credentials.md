# Retrieve Credentials {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/agektmr.html" %}
{% include "web/_shared/contributors/megginkearney.html" %}

When a user lands on your site,
retrieve the user's credentials.
Use these credentials to authenticate and sign in the user.

Make it as easy a possible for returning users to sign-in,
but once a user signs out, disable auto sign-in.

### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }

* Authenticate a user's credentials based on the credential type:
either `PasswordCredential` or `FederatedCredential`.
* Determine the credential type using the
credential `.type` property.
* Attempt to auto sign-in a user by requesting a credential object
with `unmediated:true`.
* When a user signs out, disable auto sign-in by calling
`navigator.credentials.requireUserMediation()`.

## Get user credentials

To retrieve a user's credential,
use `navigator.credentials.get()`: 

<pre class="prettyprint">
navigator.credentials.get({
  password: true,
  federated: {
    providers: [
      'https://account.google.com',
      'https://www.facebook.com'
    ]
  },
  unmediated: true
}).then(function(cred) {
  // examine the credential object
});
</pre>

`navigator.credentials.get()` returns a promise that resolves
with a credential object as an argument.
The obtained credential object can be either
[PasswordCredential](#authenticate-with-a-server) or
[FederatedCredential](#authenticate-with-an-identity-provider).
If no credential information exists, `null` gets returned.

### Parameters

A credential includes the following parameters:

<table class="responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan=2>Parameters</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>password</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>Boolean</code><br>
        Value is `true` if you want to retrieve `PasswordCredentials`.
        Defaults to `false`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>federated/code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>Object</code><br>
        Object that accepts `provider` or `protocol` as keys
        which has array of params.
        Object `provider` accepts an array of strings that identify providers.
        Currently, no browsers implement `protocol`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>unmediated</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>Boolean</code><br>
        Value is `true` if you want to avoid showing account chooser UI.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Determine credential type

Examine the `.type` property,
to determine wheter to authenticate via your server,
or through an identity provider.

If the `.type` is federated,
examine the `.provider` property
to determine which identity provider.
The value in `.provider` must match saved value when
[storing the credential](/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management/store-credentials).

For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
if (cred) {
  switch (cred.type) {
    case 'password':
      // authenticate with a server
      break;
    case 'federated':
      switch (cred.provider) {
        case 'https://accounts.google.com':
          // run google identity authentication flow
          break;
        case 'https://www.facebook.com':
          // run facebook identity authentication flow
          break;
      }
      break;
  }
} else {
  // auto sign-in not possible
  â€¦
}
</pre>

## Authenticate user

Once a credential is retrieved,
authenticate the user either with a server or with an identity provider.

### Authenticate with a server

If a `PasswordCredential` is obtained,
POST it to your server using `fetch()`, verify the credential,
then let the user sign in.

POST it directly as if it is a `FormData` object using `fetch()`,
including `id` and `password` (XMLHttpRequest cannot be used).
The payload is `multipart/form-data` encoding by default and looks something like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
------WebKitFormBoundaryOkstjzGAv8zab97W                                                
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="id"                                            

chromedemojp@gmail.com                                                                       
------WebKitFormBoundaryOkstjzGAv8zab97W                                                
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="password"                                         

testtest                                                                                
------WebKitFormBoundaryOkstjzGAv8zab97W--
</pre>

### Parameters

An obtained `PasswordCredential` object includes following parameters:

<table class="responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan=2>Parameters</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>id</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>String</code><br>
        User identifier string.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>password/code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>String</code><br>
        Opaque password you can't obtain using JavaScript.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>name</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>String</code><br>
        User name string.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>iconURL</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>String</code><br>
        User icon image url string.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Change parameters

Change the param keys by assigning a string to `.idName` or `.passwordName`.

You can also add extra parameters such as a CSRF token
by assigning a `FormData` as `.additionalData` property and append key-values to it.

For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
}).then(function(cred) {
  if (cred) {
    if (cred.type == 'password') {
      // Use `email` instead of `id` for the id
      cred.idName = 'email';

      // Append CSRF Token
      var csrf_token = document.querySelector('#csrf_token').value;
      var form = new FormData();
      form.append('csrf_token', csrf_token);

      // Append additional credential data to `.additionalData`
      cred.additionalData = form;

      // `POST` the credential object.
      // id, password and the additional data will be encoded and
      // sent to the url as the HTTP body.
      fetch(url, {           // Make sure the URL is HTTPS
        method: 'POST',      // Use POST
        credentials: cred    // Add the password credential object
      }).then(function() {
        // continuation
      });
    } else if (cred.type == 'federated') {
      // continuation
</pre>

You can do a similar thing by assigning a `URLSearchParams` object instead of a `FormData`
to `.additionalData`.
In this case,
the whole credential object is encoded using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### Authenticate with an identity provider

If a `FederatedCredential` is obtained,
run an identity provider specific authentication flow to authenticate the user.
For example, if the provider is Google, use the
[Google Sign-In JavaScript library](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/).

For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// Instantiate an auth object
var auth2 = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance();
// Is this user already signed in?
if (auth2.isSignedIn.get()) {
  var googleUser = auth2.currentUser.get();
  // Same user as in the credential object?
  if (googleUser.getBasicProfile().getEmail() === id) {
    // Continue with the signed-in user.
    return Promise.resolve(googleUser);
  }
}
// Otherwise, run a new authentication flow.
return auth2.signIn({
  login_hint: id || ''
});
</pre>

Google Sign-In results in an id token as a proof of authentication
which you send to the server to create a session,
but it depends on how you want to manage sessions.

For additional identity providers,
please refer to respective documentation, such as
[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login),
[Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in/implementing),
[GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

## Auto sign-in a user

To auto sign-in a user,
request a credential object with `unmediated: true`,
as soon as they land on your website, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
navigator.credentials.get({
  password: true,
  federated: {
    providers: [
      'https://account.google.com',
      'https://www.facebook.com'
    ]
  },
  unmediated: true // request a credential without user mediation
}).then(function(cred) {
  // ...
});
</pre>

This request resolves immediately with a credential object
and won't display an account chooser.
When the browser obtains credential information,
a notification pops up:

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/auto-sign-in.png">
  <figcaption>Notification pop-up for automatically signed-in user.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the case of a `null` value,
continue with the user in signed out state.

A `null` value is passed when:

* The user has not acknowledged the automatic sign-in feature
(once per browser instance).
* The user has none or more than two credential objects stored to the origin.
* The user has requested to require user mediation to the origin.

## Sign in a user via account chooser

If a user requires mediation, or has multiple accounts,
use the account chooser to let the user sign-in,
skipping the ordinary sign-in form.

The account chooser typically gets invoked
when the user indicates to sign-in by tapping on the "Sign-In" button.
The user can select an account to sign-in, for example:

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/account-chooser.png">
  <figcaption>Account chooser UI, allowing user to select an account to sign-in.</figcaption>
</figure>

To enable the account chooser,
set `unmediated` property to `true`:

<pre class="prettyprint">
navigator.credentials.get({
  password: true,
  federated: {
    providers: [
      'https://account.google.com',
      'https://www.facebook.com'
    ]
  },
  <strong>unmediated: true </strong>// request a credential without user mediation
}).then(function(cred) {
  // ...
});
</pre>

This request resolves with a credential object
when the user chooses one of the accounts.

A `null` value is passed when the user cancels the account chooser.
In the case of a `null` value,
proceed to a sign-in form so that the user can sign in using a different account.

## Disable auto sign-in

When a user signs out from your website,
it's your responsibility to ensure that the user does not automatically get signed back in.
To disable auto sign-in,
call [`navigator.credentials.requireUserMediation()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/requireUserMediation):

<pre class="prettyprint">
// After a user signing out...
navigator.credentials.requireUserMediation();
</pre>

This lets `navigator.credentials.get()` with `unmediated: true` return a `null`
so auto sign-in won't happen.
The status is for the same origin and is stored to the browser instance.

To resume auto sign-in, 
a user can choose to intentionally sign-in,
for example, by tapping on the "Sign-In" button.
In this case,
call `navigator.credentials.get()` with `unmediated: false`.

Moving forward,
unless signing out again,
the user is always signed back in whenever coming back to the same website.
