Every day, cybercriminals compromise thousands of websites. Hacks are
often invisible to users, yet remain harmful to anyone viewing the page
— including the site owner. For example, unbeknownst to the site owner,
the hacker may have infected their site with harmful code which in turn
can record keystrokes on visitors’ computers, stealing login credentials
for online banking or financial transactions. If you’re not sure whether
