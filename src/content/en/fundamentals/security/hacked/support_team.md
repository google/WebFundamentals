## You'll need

* The ability to contact your hoster


<div class="clearfix"></div>

## Next actions


### 1. Tell your hoster that your site has been compromised.

Your hoster can make sure their other customers weren't affected, and they can
potentially help recover your site. In [StopBadware’s 2012 survey](https://www.stopbadware.org/files/compromised-websites-an-owners-perspective.pdf),
60% of people who asked their hoster for help, received it.


### 2. Locate reputable online resources and helpful communities.</strong>

Your goal is to find out where to turn if you have problems with the recovery
process. In addition to the *Help for hacked sites* series and your hoster's
help system, try searching and reading responses in discussion forums or even
posting a question yourself.

These communities are good starting points:

* [StopBadware.org](https://www.stopbadware.org) offers
[articles](https://www.stopbadware.org/common-hacks) and
[tools](https://www.stopbadware.org/hacked-sites-resources).
* [Google Webmaster Central](http://www.google.com/webmasters/)'s discussion
forum has a special subforum for
[Malware and hacked sites](http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!categories/webmasters/malware--hacked-sites).
Most responses come from highly engaged members and the community's
[Top Contributors](https://sites.google.com/site/webmasterhelpforum/en/bionic-posters).


### 3.Consider enlisting assistance from a trusted security expert.

If you feel ill-equipped to recover your site on your own, try the following options:

* Ask friends and family for recommendations.
* Seek referrals from the standout members of reputable online communities.
* Transfer your site to new hoster who specializes in site recovery and can
  recover your site as part of the transfer.
