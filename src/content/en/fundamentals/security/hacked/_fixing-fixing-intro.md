Before you start, make an offline copy of any files before you remove
them, in case you need to restore them later. Better yet, back up your
entire site before you start the cleanup process. You can do this by
saving all the files that are on your server to a location off your
server or searching for the best backup options for your particular
Content Management System (CMS). If youâ€™re using a CMS, you should
back up the database as well.
