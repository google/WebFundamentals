Start by checking the
[Security Issues](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/security-issues)
tool in Search Console to see if Google has discovered any of these hacked
pages on your site. Sometimes you can also uncover pages like this by
opening a Google Search window and typing in `site:_your site url_`, with
the root level URL of your site. This will show you the pages that Google
has indexed for your site, including the hacked pages. Flip through a
couple of pages of search results to see if you spot any unusual URLs.
If you don’t see any hacked content in Google Search, use the same search
terms with a different search engine. An example of what that would
look like is below.

Note: Notice that the search results here contain many pages not created by
the site owner. If you look closely at the descriptions, you’ll see
examples of the gibberish text that this hack creates.

Typically, when you click a link to a hacked page you will either be
redirected to another site, or you will see a page full of gibberish
content. However, you might also see a message suggesting that the page
does not exist (for example, a 404 error). Don’t be fooled! Hackers will
try to trick you into thinking the page is gone or fixed when it’s
still hacked. They do this by [cloaking](//support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355)
content. Check for cloaking by entering your site’s URLs in the
[Fetch as Google](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch)
tool. The Fetch as Google tool allows you to see the underlying hidden content.

If you see these issues, your site has most likely been affected
by this type of hack.
