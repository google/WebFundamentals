### Check to see if your site is clean

Once you’re done getting rid of hacked files, check to see if your hard
work paid off. Remember those gibberish pages you identified earlier?
Use the Fetch as Google tool on them again to see if they still exist.
If they respond as "Not Found" in Fetch as Google, chances are you’re in
pretty good shape and you can move on to fixing the vulnerabilities on your site.

Note: You can also follow the steps in the
[Hacked Sites Troubleshooter](https://support.google.com/webmasters/troubleshooter/6155978)
to check if there’s still hacked content on your site.
