# Assess malware damage {: .page-title }

This step pertains to sites hacked to distribute malware, often with
the warning _"This site may harm your computer"_ displayed in search results.
It's one of the longest steps in the recovery process. In this step, you'll
compile a list of the damaged files on your site. You'll use this list in a
later step, [Clean and maintain your site](clean_site).

Note: If your site was affected by spam, not malware, displaying the warning
_"This site may be hacked"_ in search results, please see the page
[Assess spam damage (Hacked with spam)](hacked_with_spam).

## You'll need

* Shell/terminal administrator access to your site's servers: web, database, files.
* Knowledge of shell/terminal commands.
* Ability to run SQL queries on the database.

## What you'll do {: #action }

This step has three sections:

* [Preparation](#preparation)
* [Investigation of specific malware infection types](#investigation)
* [General filesystem damage assessment](#assessment)


### Preparation {: #preparation }

1. Avoid using a browser to view pages on your site. Because malware often
   spreads by exploiting browser vulnerabilities, opening an infected malware
   page in a browser may damage your computer.
2. Create a document to record findings from this step. The document will
   eventually include (at minimum) the name/location of each file damaged and
   notes about how it was infected, and will serve as the basis for
   [Clean and maintain your site](clean_site).
3. Check out additional resources as necessary:
   * Watch the video above to see how malware works and how you can stay
     safe during your malware investigation.
   * View the [Google Safe Browsing diagnostic page](/safe-browsing/) to see
     public information about whether a site is potentially harmful to users.
     You can see the listing status for your site at a URL similar to the
     following:

        http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=<your-site>

     For example:
     `http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=webmastercentralblog.blogspot.com`
4. Use [cURL](https://www.google.com/search?q=cURL) or
   [Wget](https://www.google.com/search?q=Wget) to perform HTTP requests
   (for example, to fetch a page).

     These freely available tools are helpful in diagnosing redirects, and have
     the flexibility to include referrer or user-agent information. Including a
     specific referrer or user-agent is helpful in mimicking hackers since
     hackers may only serve malicious content to users with specific
     user-agents or referrers to target more "real people" and can avoid
     detection from site owners and malware scanners.

        curl -v --referer "http://www.google.com" <your-url>


### Investigation {: #investigation }

Investigation of specific malware infection types on your site

1. Select your verified Site in Search Console, then click **Security Issues**.
2. Investigate all malware categories (e.g., Server configuration, SQL
   injection) listed in Security Issues for your site. Additional information
   about infected URLs from the category can be found by clicking
   "Show details." (Details may include sample code snippets injected by the
   hacker.) For each category, copy into your investigation document:
    * All example infected URLs listed for the malware category in Security
      Issues.
    * Any additional damaged pages you uncover during your investigation.
    * Detailed fIndings about the infected URLs, such as the type of damage
      caused.
3. Information to aid in the investigation for each malware type is below:
    * [Server configuration](https://www.support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3024318)
    * [SQL injection](https://www.support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3024309)
    * [Error template](https://www.support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3024381)
    * [Code injection](https://www.support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3024344)

### Filesystem damage assessment {: #assessment }

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <iframe class="devsite-embedded-youtube-video" data-video-id="2A4dLkXXUjo"
          data-autohide="1" data-showinfo="0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

Next, you'll need to log in to your site's filesystem for more in-depth
investigation. Be aware that -- among other things -- the hacker may have
modified existing pages or database records, created entirely new spammy
pages, written functions to display spam on clean pages, or left "backdoors"
that will allow the hacker re-entry to your site or that will continue
performing malicious tasks if not deleted.

If your site is online, you can take it back offline for this step.

1. If you have a known good backup of your site, determine which files have
   been created or modified since the backup. Add these files to your list
   since you'll likely want to investigate further. On Unix-based systems,
   you can use a command such as:

        diff -qr <current-directory> <backup-directory>

    For example:

        diff -qr www/ backups/full-backup-20120124/

    also

        md5sum <current-page> <backup-page>

    For example:

        md5sum www/page.html backups/full-backup-20120124/page.html

2. Check **server, access, and error logs** for any suspicious activity,
   such as failed login attempts, command history (especially as root), the
   creation of unknown user accounts, and so on. Be aware that the hacker may
   have altered these logs for their own purposes. (If helpful, some examples
   are shown in the video for [Identify the vulnerability](vulnerability).)
3. Check **configuration files**, such as `.htaccess` and `httpd.conf`, for
   redirects. Hackers often create conditional redirects based on the
   user-agent, time of day, or referrer.
4. Check for too lenient folder and file permissions. Hackers tamper with
   permissions because if lenient permissions remain undetected by the site
   owner, the hacker will have a way to reenter the site. Files greater than
   `644 (rw-r--r--)` and folders greater than `755 (rwxr-xr-x)` can cause
   security issues. Make sure any looser permission are really necessary.
   On Unix-based systems, try:

        find <your-dir> -type d -not -perm 755 -exec ls -ld {} \;

    and

        find <your-dir> -type f -not -perm 644 -exec ls -la {} \;

5. If you have a database, investigate record by record using a tool like
   [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php).
