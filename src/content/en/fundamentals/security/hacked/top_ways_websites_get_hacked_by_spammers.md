# Top ways websites get hacked by spammers {: .page-title }

Understanding how your site was compromised is an important part of
protecting your site from attacks. In this article, we will cover some
security vulnerabilities that can result in your site being compromised.

## Compromised passwords

Attackers can use password guessing techniques by trying different passwords
until they guess the right one. Password guessing attacks can be conducted
through various methods such as trying common passwords or scanning through
random combinations of letters and numbers until the password is discovered.
To prevent this, create a strong password that is difficult to guess.
You can find
[tips for creating a strong password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32040)
in Google’s help center article.

There are two important points to remember. First, it’s important to avoid
reusing passwords across services. Once attackers are able to identify a
working username and password combination, they will try to use the username
and password combination on as many services as possible. Therefore,
using different passwords on different services can prevent other
accounts on other services from being compromised.

Second, take advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) like
[Google 2-Step Verification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) if
the option is available. 2FA allows a second layer of login credentials,
usually via a text message code or other dynamically generated pin,
that diminishes an attacker’s ability to access your account with just a
stolen password. Some CMS providers have guidance on configuring 2FA:
see documentation for
[Joomla!](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Two_Factor_Authentication),
[WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Two_Step_Authentication),
or [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/tfa).

## Missing security updates

Older versions of software can be affected by high-risk security
vulnerabilities that enable attackers to compromise an entire site.
Attackers actively seek out old software with vulnerabilities. Ignoring
a vulnerability on your site increases the chance of your site being attacked.

Note: It’s essential to periodically check for software updates for your
site in order to patch vulnerabilities. Better yet, set up automatic
updates for your software where possible and sign up for security
announcement lists for any of your active running software.

Some examples of software to you’ll want to keep updated include:

* Web server software, if you run your own servers
* Content Management System. Example: security releases from
  [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/news/category/security/),
  [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/security), and
  [Joomla!](https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre.html).
* All plugins and add-ons you use on your site

## Insecure Themes and Plugins

Plugins and themes on a CMS add valuable, enhanced functionality. However,
outdated or unpatched themes and plugins are a major source of
vulnerabilities on websites. If you use themes or plugins on your
site, make sure to keep them up to date. Remove themes or plugins
that are no longer maintained by their developers.

Be extremely cautious of free plugins or themes from untrusted
sites. It’s a common tactic for attackers to add malicious code to
free versions of paid plugins or themes. When removing a plugin,
make sure to remove all its files from your server rather than
simply disabling it.

## Social engineering

[Social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))
is about exploiting human nature to bypass sophisticated security
infrastructure. These types of attacks trick authorized users into
providing confidential information such as passwords. For example,
a common form of social engineering is phishing. During a phishing
attempt, an attacker will send an email pretending to be a legitimate
organization and request confidential information.

Caution: According to a
[study from Google about social engineering](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub43469.html),
some of the most effective phishing campaigns have a 45% success rate!

Remember never to give out any sensitive information (e.g. passwords,
credit card numbers, banking information, or even your date of birth)
unless you’re sure about the requestor’s identity. If your site is managed
by several people, consider providing training to raise security awareness
against social engineering attacks. You can refer to the Gmail Help Center
for [basic phishing protection tips](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8253).

## Security policy holes

If you are a system administrator or run your own site, remember that
poor security policies can allow attackers to compromise your site.
Some examples include:

* Allowing users to create weak passwords
* Giving administrative access to users who don’t require it
* Not enabling HTTPS on your site and allowing users to sign in using HTTP
* Allowing file uploads from unauthenticated users, or with no type checking

A few basic tips to protect your site:

* Ensure your website is configured with high security controls by disabling
  unnecessary services
* Test access controls and user privileges
* Use encryption for pages that handle sensitive information, like login pages
* Regularly checking your logs for any suspicious activities.

## Data leaks

Data leaks can happen when confidential data is uploaded and a
misconfiguration makes that confidential information publicly available.
For example, error handling and messaging in a web application can
potentially leak configuration information in an unhandled error message.
Using a method known as ["dorking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking),
malicious actors can exploit search engine functionality to find this data.

Ensure that your site doesn’t reveal sensitive information to
unauthorized users by conducting periodic checks and restricting
confidential data to trusted entities through security policies. If
you do happen to discover any sensitive information displayed on your
site that urgently needs to be removed from Google Search results, you
can use the [URL removal tool](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals)
to remove individual URLs from Google Search.
