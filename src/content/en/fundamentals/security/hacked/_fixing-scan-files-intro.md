Once you have a list of suspicious PHP files, check to see if they
are malicious. If you’re unfamiliar with PHP, this process might be
more time consuming, so consider brushing up on some
[PHP documentation](https://php.net/docs.php). If you’re completely
new to coding, we recommend [getting help](support_team). In the meantime,
there are some basic patterns that you can look for to identify malicious files.

If you use a CMS, and are not in the habit of editing those files
directly, compare the files on your server to a list of the default
files packaged with the CMS and any plugins and themes. Look for files
that do not belong, as well as files whose sizes seem larger than their
defaults.
