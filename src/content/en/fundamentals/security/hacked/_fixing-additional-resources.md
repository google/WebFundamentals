If you’re still having trouble fixing your site, there are a few more

[Aw-snap.info](http://aw-snap.info/),
[Sucuri Site Check](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/),
[Quttera](http://www.quttera.com/): These are just some tools that may be
able to scan your site for problematic content. Keep in mind that these
scanners can’t guarantee that they will identify every type of
problematic content.
