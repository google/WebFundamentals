Locate your `.htaccess` file on your site. If you’re not sure where to find it
and you’re using a CMS like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal, search for
".htaccess file location" in a search engine along with the name of your CMS.
Depending on your site, you might see multiple `.htaccess` files. 
Make a list of all of `.htaccess` file locations.

Note: The `.htaccess` is often a "hidden file." Make sure to enable showing
hidden files when you’re searching for it.
