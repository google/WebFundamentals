Replace all `.htaccess` files with a clean or default version of the
`.htaccess` file. You can usually find a default version of a `.htaccess` 
file by searching for "default `.htaccess` file" and the name of your CMS.
For sites with multiple `.htaccess` files, find a clean version of each one
and perform the replacement.

If no default `.htaccess` exists and youâ€™ve never configured an `.htaccess`
file on your site, the `.htaccess` file you find on your site is probably
malicious. Save a copy of the `.htaccess` file(s) offline just in case and
delete the `.htaccess` file from your site.
