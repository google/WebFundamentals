If you use a CMS, reinstall all the core (default) files that come in the
default distribution of your CMS, as well as anything you may have added
(such as themes, modules, plugins). This helps ensure that these files are
clear of hacked content. You can do a Google search for "reinstall"
and your CMS name to find instructions on the reinstallation process.
If you have any plugins, modules, extensions, or themes, make sure
to reinstall those as well.

Caution: Reinstalling your core files can cause you to lose any
customizations that youâ€™ve made. Be sure to create a backup of your
database and all files before you reinstall.
