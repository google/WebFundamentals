# Assess spam damage {: .page-title }

This step pertains to sites hacked to host spam, often with the warning
_"This site may be hacked"_ displayed in search results. It's one of the
longest steps in the recovery process. In this step, you'll compile a list of
the damaged files on your site. You'll use this list in a later step,
[Clean and maintain your site](clean_site).

Note: If your site was affected by malware and is flagged with the warning
_"This site may harm your computer"_ in search results, please see the
corresponding article,
[Assess malware damage (Hacked with malware)](hacked_with_malware).
