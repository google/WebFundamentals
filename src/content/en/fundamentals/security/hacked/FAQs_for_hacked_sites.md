# FAQs for hacked sites {: .page-title }

This article brings together answers to the questions about hacking we at
Google hear most often.

## Why did my site get hacked? {: #mean }

Hackers have different motives for compromising a website. Examples include:

* **Financial gain through web spam:** Placing spam links on your website or
  redirecting your website's traffic to external parties.
* **Stealing sensitive information:** Copying files containing customer
  data like credit card numbers, personally identifiable information, or
  login credentials.
* **Communicating a political or social message:** Defacing a website as a
  form of hacktivism to emphasize a point of view and cause change.
* **Malware:** Injecting malicious code through scripts or iFrames that pull
  content from another website that tries to attack any computer that views
  the page.
* **Thrill-seeking or vandalism:** For no particular reason other than the
  thrill of invading and vandalizing your site.

## How do I know I’ve been hacked? {: #know }

Examples of common signs that your website has been attacked include
unusual traffic spikes (especially from unrelated search terms), visitors
reporting malware, newly created account(s) with administrator privileges,
