<p>
  <b>Mixed content</b> refers to a webpage where the initial HTML content is loaded 
  securely over HTTPS and that content then loads follow-up resources (such as 
  images, videos, stylesheets, scripts) over insecure HTTP. This is called mixed 
  content because both HTTP and HTTPS content are being loaded to display the same 
  page, and the initial request was secure over HTTPS. Modern browsers display 
  warnings about this type of content to indicate to the user that this page 
  contains insecure resources.

This guide introduces mixed content and the dangers it poses to your website and 
users. To learn how you can fix mixed content issues, see our next guide on

## Resource request and web browsers

When a browser _visits_ a page of a website, it is making a request for an HTML 
resource. The web server then returns the HTML content, which the browser parses 
and displays to the users. Often a single HTML file isn't enough to display a 
complete page, so the HTML file includes references to other resources that need 
to be requested by the browser. These subresources can be things like images, 
videos, extra HTML, CSS, or JavaScript; which are each fetched using separate 
requests. 

## HTTPS benefits

When a browser requests resources over HTTPS - which stands for HTTP Secure - it 
uses an encrypted connection to communicate with the web server.

Using HTTPS has 3 main benefits:

* Authentication
* Data integrity
* Secrecy

### Authentication

_Is the website I'm talking to who they claim to be?_ 

HTTPS lets the browser check that it has opened the correct website and hasn't 
been redirected to a malicious site. When navigating to your bank's website, 
your browser _authenticates_ the website, thus preventing an attacker from 
impersonating your bank and stealing your login credentials. 

### Data integrity

_Has anyone tampered with the content I am sending or receiving?_ 

HTTPS lets the browser detect if an attacker has changed any data the browser 
receives. When transferring money using your bank's website, this prevents an 
attacker from changing the destination account number while your request is in 
transit. 

### Secrecy

_Can anyone see the content I am sending or receiving?_

HTTPS prevents an attacker from eavesdropping on the browser's requests, 
tracking the websites visited, or stealing information sent or received. 

### HTTPS, TLS, and SSL

HTTPS stands for HTTP Secure, Hyper(t)ext Transfer Protocol Secure. The 
**secure** portion here comes from the encryption added to the requests sent 
and received by the browser. Currently most browsers use the **TLS** protocol to 
provide encryption; TLS is sometimes referred to as SSL. 

The details of HTTPS, TLS, and SSL are beyond the scope of this article, but if 
you want to learn more, these resources are a good place to start:

* [Wikipedia TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
* [Khan Academy Cryptography course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography) 
* [TLS chapter](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch04.html) in [High Performance Browser Networking](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545) by Ilya Grigorik 

## Mixed content weakens HTTPS

Requesting subresources using the insecure HTTP protocol weakens the security of 
the entire page, as these requests are vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle 
attacks**, where an attacker eavesdrops on a network connection and views or 
modifies the communication between two parties. Using these resources, an 
attacker can often take complete control over the page, not just the compromised 
resource. 

Although many browsers report mixed content warnings to the user, by the time 
this happens, it is too late: the insecure requests have already been performed 
and the security of the page is compromised. This scenario is, unfortunately, 
quite common in the web, which is why browsers can't just block all mixed 
requests without restricting the functionality of many sites.

It's up to you, the developer, to fix mixed content issues in your application.

### A simple example

Loading an insecure script from an HTTPS page.

Viewing this sample page over **HTTPS** — [**https**://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/.../simple-example.html](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/samples/discovery-and-distribution/avoid-mixed-content/simple-example.html) — includes 
an **HTTP** script tag which attempts to load mixed content. 

{% include_code src=_code/simple-example.html snippet=snippet1 %}

In this example, the script `simple-example.js` is loaded with an **HTTP** URL. This 
is the simplest case of mixed content. When the `simple-example.js` file is 
requested by the browser, an attacker can inject code into the returned content 
and take control of the entire page. 

Thankfully, most modern browsers block this type of dangerous content by 
default. See [browser behavior with mixed content](#browser-behavior-with-mixed-content).

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/simple-mixed-content-error.png" alt="Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.">
  <figcaption>Chrome blocks the insecure script.</figcaption>
</figure>

### An XMLHttpRequest example

Loading insecure data with XMLHttpRequest.

Viewing this sample page over **HTTPS** — [**https**://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/.../xmlhttprequest-example.html](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/samples/discovery-and-distribution/avoid-mixed-content/xmlhttprequest-example.html) — 
includes an `XMLHttpRequest` over **HTTP** to fetch mixed content `JSON` data.

{% include_code src=_code/xmlhttprequest-example.html snippet=snippet1 %} 

Here the **HTTP** URL is constructed dynamically in JavaScript, and is eventually 
used to load an insecure resource by `XMLHttpRequest`. Like the simple example 
above, when the `xmlhttprequest-data.js` file is requested by the browser, an 
attacker can inject code into the returned content and take control of the 
entire page.

Most modern browsers block these dangerous requests as well.

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/xmlhttprequest-mixed-content-error.png" alt="Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.">
  <figcaption>Chrome blocks the insecure XMLHttpRequest.</figcaption>
</figure>

### An image gallery example

Loading insecure images with jQuery lightbox.

Viewing this sample page over **HTTPS** — [**https**://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/.../image-gallery-example.html](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/samples/discovery-and-distribution/avoid-mixed-content/image-gallery-example.html) — 
initially does not have any mixed content problems, however when the thumbnail 
image is clicked, a full size mixed content image is loaded over **HTTP**. 

{% include_code src=_code/image-gallery-example.html snippet=snippet1 %}

Image galleries often rely on the `<img>` tag `src` attribute to display 
thumbnail images on the page, the anchor (`<a>`) tag `href` attribute is 
then used to load the full sized image for the gallery overlay. Normally 
`<a>` tags do not cause mixed content, but in this case, the jQuery code 
overrides the default link behavior — to navigate to a new page — and instead 
loads the **HTTP** image on this page. 

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/image-gallery-warning.png" alt="Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image. This content should also be served over HTTPS.">
</figure>

Insecure images degrade the security of your site, but they are not as dangerous 
as other types of mixed content. Modern browsers still load mixed content 
images, but display warnings to the user as well. 

## Mixed content types & security threats associated

The two types of mixed content are: active and passive. 

**Passive mixed content** refers to content that doesn't interact with the rest 
of the page, and thus a man-in-the-middle attack is restricted to what they can 
do if they intercept or change that content. Passive mixed content includes 
images, video, and audio content, along with other resources that cannot interact 
with the rest of the page.  

**Active mixed content** interacts with the page as a whole and will allow an 
attacker to do almost anything with the page. Active mixed content includes 
scripts, stylesheets, iframes, flash resources, and other code that can be 
downloaded and executed by the browser.

### Passive mixed content

Passive mixed content still poses a security threat to your site and your users. 
For example, an attacker can intercept HTTP requests for images on your site and 
swap or replace these images; the attacker can swap the _save_ and _delete_ 
button images, causing your users to delete content without intending to; 
replace your product diagrams with lewd or pornographic content, defacing your 
site; or replace your product pictures with ads for a different site or product. 

Even if the attacker doesn't alter the content of your site, you still have a 
large privacy issue where an attacker can track users using mixed content 
requests. The attacker can tell which pages a user visits and which products 
they view based on images or other resources loaded by the browser. 

The following are example of passive mixed content: 

{% include_code src=_code/passive-mixed-content.html snippet=snippet1 %}

Most browsers still render this type of mixed content to the user, however a 
warning is also displayed as this poses a security and privacy risk to your site 
and users. 

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/passive-mixed-content-warnings.png" alt="Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure video. This content should also be served over HTTPS.">
  <figcaption>Mixed content warnings from the Chrome JavaScript console.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Active mixed content

Active mixed content poses a greater threat than passive. An attacker can 
intercept and rewrite active content thereby taking full control of your page or 
even your entire website. This allows the attacker to change anything about the 
page, including displaying entirely different content, stealing user passwords 
or other login credentials, stealing user session cookies, or redirecting the 
user to a different site entirely. 

Due to the severity of this threat, many browsers block this type of content by 
default to protect users, but functionality varies between browser vendors and 
versions.

The following are examples of active mixed content:

{% include_code src=_code/active-mixed-content.html snippet=snippet1 %}

{% include_code src=_code/active-mixed-content.html snippet=snippet2 %}


<figure>
  <img src="imgs/active-mixed-content-errors.png" alt="Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.">
  <figcaption>Mixed content errors from the Chrome JavaScript console.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Browser behavior with mixed content

Due to the threats described above, it would be ideal for browsers to block all 
mixed content. However this would break a large number of websites that millions 
of users rely on every day. The current compromise is to block the most 
dangerous types of mixed content, and allow the less dangerous types to still be 
requested. 

Modern browsers follow [mixed content specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/), which defines [**optionally blockable content**](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#category-optionally-blockable) and [**blockable content**](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#category-blockable) categories. 

From the spec, resources qualify as optionally blockable content "when the risk 
of allowing its usage as mixed content is outweighed by the risk of breaking 
significant portions of the web"; this is a subset of the [passive mixed 
content](#passive-mixed-content) category described above. At the time of this writing, images, 
video, and audio resources, as well as prefetched links, are the only 
resource types included in optionally blockable content. This category is 
likely to get smaller as time goes on.

All content that is not **optionally blockable** is considered **blockable**, 
and is blocked by the browser. 

### Browser versions

It is important to remember that not every visitor of your website will be using 
the most up to date browsers. Different versions from different browser vendors 
each behave differently with mixed content. At worst, some browsers and versions 
don't block any mixed content at all, which is very unsafe for the user. 

The exact behavior of each browser is constantly changing, so we won't include 
specifics here. If you're interested in how a specific browser behaves, look for 
information published by the vendors directly.
