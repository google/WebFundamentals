# Discovery and Monetization {: .page-title }

Broaden your website's audience and increase revenue.

Online advertisements are one way to monetize your site or app.
[Google's AdSense site](https://www.google.com/adsense) has resources and
instructions to help you through that. To earn those revenues you need to
bring more people to your site.

## Payment Request API

<img src="/web/images/md-icons/money-square.png" class="attempt-right">

The Payment Request API is an open and cross-browser standard that replaces
traditional checkout flows by allowing merchants to request and accept any
payment in a single API call. The PaymentRequest API allows the web page to
exchange information with the user agent while the user is providing input,
before approving or denying a payment request.

Best of all, with the browser acting as an intermediary, all the information
necessary for a fast checkout can be stored in the browser, so users can just
confirm and pay, all with a single click.
