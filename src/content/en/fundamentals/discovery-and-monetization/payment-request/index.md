Dogfood: <code>PaymentRequest</code> is still in development. While we think
it's stable enough to implement, it may continue to change. We'll <a
href="/web/updates/2017/01/payment-request-updates">keep this page updated</a>
to always reflect the current status of the API. Meanwhile, to protect yourself
from API changes that may be backwards incompatible, we're offering <a
href="https://storage.googleapis.com/prshim/v1/payment-shim.js">a shim</a> that
can be embedded on your site. The shim will paper over any API differences for
two major Chrome versions.


Buying goods online is a convenient but often frustrating experience,
particularly on mobile devices. Although mobile traffic continues to increase,
mobile conversions account for only about a third of all completed purchases. In
other words, users abandon mobile purchases twice as often as desktop purchases.
Why?

![](images/1_why_users_abandon.png)

*Why users abandon mobile purchase forms*

Online purchase forms are user-intensive, difficult to use, slow to load and
refresh, and require multiple steps to complete. This is because two primary
components of online payments&mdash;security and convenience&mdash;often work at
cross-purposes; more of one typically means less of the other.

Most of the problems that lead to abandonment can be directly traced to purchase
forms. Each app or site has its own data entry and validation process, and users
often find they must enter the same information at every app's purchase point.
Also, application developers struggle to create purchase flows that support
multiple unique payment methods; even small differences in payment method
requirements can complicate the form completion and submission process.

Any system that improves or solves one or more of those problems is a welcome
change. We started solving the problem already with
[Autofill](/web/updates/2015/06/checkout-faster-with-autofill), but now we'd
like to talk about a more comprehensive solution.

## Introducing the Payment Request API {: #introducing }

The Payment Request API is a system that is meant to *eliminate checkout forms*.
It vastly improves user workflow during the purchase process, providing a more
consistent user experience and enabling web merchants to easily leverage
disparate payment methods. The Payment Request API is not a new payment method,
nor does it integrate directly with payment processors; rather, it is a process
layer whose goals are:

* To let the browser act as intermediary among merchants, users, and payment
  methods
* To standardize the payment communication flow as much as possible
* To seamlessly support different secure payment methods
* To work on any browser, device, or platform&mdash;mobile or otherwise

The Payment Request API is an open and cross-browser standard that replaces
traditional checkout flows by allowing merchants to request and accept any
payment in a single API call. The Payment Request API allows the web page to
exchange information with the user agent while the user is providing input,
before approving or denying a payment request.

Best of all, with the browser acting as an intermediary, all the information
necessary for a fast checkout can be stored in the browser, so users can just
confirm and pay, all with a single click.

### Payment transaction process {: #transaction-process }
Using the Payment Request API, the transaction process is made as seamless as
possible for both users and merchants.

![](images/4_the_payment_transaction_process.png)

*The payment transaction process*

The process begins when the merchant site creates a new `PaymentRequest` and
passes to the browser all the information required to make the purchase: the
amount to be charged, what currency they expect payment in, and what payment
methods are accepted by the site. The browser determines compatibility between
the accepted payment methods for the site and the methods the user has installed
on the target device.

<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/5_9_payment_request_ui.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


The browser then presents the payments UI to the user, who selects a payment
method and authorizes the transaction. A payment method can be as
straightforward as a credit card that is already stored by the browser, or as
esoteric as third-party application written specifically to deliver payments to
the site (this functionality is coming soon). After the user authorizes the
transaction, all the necessary payment details are sent directly back to the
site. For example, for a credit card payment, the site will get back a card
number, a cardholder name, an expiration date, and a CVC.

Payment Request can also be extended to return additional information, such as
shipping addresses and options, payer email, and payer phone. This allows you to
get all the information you need to finalize a payment without ever showing the
user a checkout form.


The beauty of the new process is threefold: from the user's perspective, all the
previously tedious interaction&mdash;request, authorization, payment, and
result&mdash;now takes place in a single step; from the website's perspective,
it requires only a single JavaScript API call; from the payment method's
perspective, there is no process change whatsoever.

## Using the Payment Request API {: #using }

### Load Payment Request API shim

To mitigate pains of catching up with this living standard API, we strongly
recommend you to add this shim in `<head>` section of your code. This shim
will be updated as API changes and will do its best to keep your code working
at least 2 major releases of Chrome.


    <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prshim/v1/payment-shim.js">


### Create a PaymentRequest {: #create-paymentrequest }

The first step is to create a
[`PaymentRequest`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentrequest-interface)
object by calling the
[`PaymentRequest`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentrequest-constructor)
constructor. This step is typically (but not always) associated with a
user-initiated action indicating their intent to make a purchase. The object is
constructed using parameters that contain required data.

    var request = new PaymentRequest(
      methodData, // required payment method data
      details,    // required information about transaction
      options     // optional parameter for things like shipping, etc.
    );


*PaymentRequest constructor*

#### The methodData parameter {: #methoddata-parameter }

The `methodData` parameter contains a list of supported payment methods and, if
relevant, additional information about the payment method. This sequence
contains `PaymentMethodData` dictionaries, including standard identifiers that
are associated with the payment methods the app intends to accept, and any
payment method-specific data. See [Payment Request API
Architecture](https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/specs/architecture.html)
for more details.

Right now, `PaymentRequest` in Chrome only supports the following standard
credit cards: '`amex`', '`diners`', '`discover`', '`jcb`', '`maestro`',
'`mastercard`', '`unionpay`', and '`visa`'.


    var methodData = [{
      supportedMethods: [ "basic-card" ],
      data: {
        supportedNetworks: [ "visa", "mastercard" ]
      }
    }]

*Payment methods and data*

#### The details parameter {: #details-parameter }

The `details` parameter contains information about the transaction. There are
two major components: a total, which reflects the total amount and currency to
be charged, and an optional set of `displayItems` that indicate how the final
amount was calculated. This parameter is not intended to be a line-item list,
but is rather a summary of the order's major components: subtotal, discounts,
tax, shipping costs, etc.

<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/6_order_summary.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

It is important to note that the Payment Request API does not do arithmetic.
That is, it does not and cannot ensure that the display components correctly sum
to the total amount due. These calculations are the developer's responsibility.
So you should always ensure that the list items sum to the same amount in the
total. Also, `PaymentRequest` doesn't support refunds, so the amounts should
always be positive (but individual list items can be negative, such as
discounts).

The browser will render the labels as you define them and automatically render
the correct currency formatting based on the user's locale. Note that the labels
should be rendered in the same language as your content.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

    var details = {
      displayItems: [
        {
          label: "Original donation amount",
          amount: { currency: "USD", value : "65.00" }, // US$65.00
        },
        {
          label: "Friends and family discount",
          amount: { currency: "USD", value : "-10.00" }, // -US$10.00
          pending: true // The price is not determined yet
        }
      ],
      total:  {
        label: "Total",
        amount: { currency: "USD", value : "55.00" }, // US$55.00
      }
    }


*Transaction details*

`pending` is commonly used to show items such as shipping or tax amounts that
depend upon selection of shipping address or shipping option. Chrome indicates
pending fields in the UI for the payment request.

Repeated or calculated values used in the `details` can be specified either as
string literals or as individual string variables.


    var currency = "USD"; // Currency definition supports ISO4217.
    var amount = "65.00";
    var discount = "-10.00";
    var total = "55.00";


*PaymentRequest variables*

### Display the PaymentRequest {: #display-paymentrequest }

<div class="attempt-left">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/7_display_payment_request.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Activate the `PaymentRequest` interface by calling its
[`show()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show) method. This method
invokes a native UI that allows the user to examine the details of the purchase,
add or change information, and finally, pay. A
[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
(indicated by its `then()` method and callback function) that resolves will be
returned when the user accepts or rejects the payment request.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

    request.show().then(function(paymentResponse) {
      // Process paymentResponse here
      paymentResponse.complete("success");
    }).catch(function(err) {
      console.error("Uh oh, something bad happened", err.message);
    });


*PaymentRequest show method*

### Abort a Payment Request {: #abort-paymentrequest }
You can intentionally abort a `PaymentRequest` by calling its
[`abort()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#abort) method. This is
particulary useful when the shopping session is timed out or an item in the cart
sells out during the transaction.

Use this method if the app needs to cancel the payment request after the
`show()` method has been called but before the promise has been resolved &mdash;
For example, if an item is no longer available, or the user fails to confirm the
purchase within an allotted amount of time.

If you abort a request, you'll need to create a new instance of `PaymentRequest`
before you can call `show()` again.


    var paymentTimeout = window.setTimeout(function() {
      window.clearTimeout(paymentTimeout);
      request.abort().then(function() {
        console.log('Payment timed out after 20 minutes.');
      }).catch(function() {
        console.log('Unable to abort.');
      });
    }, 20 * 60 * 1000);  /* 20 minutes */


*PaymentRequest abort method*

### Process the PaymentResponse {: # process-paymentresponse}
Upon a user approval for a payment request, the
[`show()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show) method's promise
resolves, resulting in a `PaymentResponse` object.

<table class="properties responsive">
<tr>
  <th colspan="2"><code>PaymentResponse</code> has the following fields:</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>methodName</code></td>
  <td>A string indicating what the chosen payment method is (e.g., visa)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>details</code></td>
  <td>A dictionary containing information for <code>methodName</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>shippingAddress</code></td>
  <td>The shipping address of the user, if requested</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>shippingOption</code></td>
  <td>The ID of the selected shipping option, if requested</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>payerEmail</code></td>
  <td>The email address of the payer, if requested</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>payerPhone</code></td>
  <td>The phone number of the payer, if requested</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>payerName</code></td>
  <td>The name of the payer, if requested</td>
</tr>
</table>


For credit card payments, the response is standardized. For non-credit card
payments (e.g., Android Pay), the response will be documented by the provider. A
credit card response contains the following dictionary:

`cardholderName`
`cardNumber`
`expiryMonth`
`expiryYear`
`cardSecurityCode`
`billingAddress`

After payment information is received, the app should submit the payment
information to your payment processor for processing. The UI will show a spinner
while the request takes place. When a response has come back, the app should
call `complete()` to close the UI.


    request.show().then(paymentResponse => {
      var paymentData = {
        // payment method string, e.g. “visa”
        method: paymentResponse.methodName,
        // payment details as you requested
        details: paymentResponse.details
      };
      return fetch('/pay', {
        method: 'POST',
        credentials: 'include',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(paymentData)
      }).then(res => {
        if (res.status === 200) {
          return res.json();
        } else {
          throw 'Payment Error';
        }
      }).then(res => {
        paymentResponse.complete("success");
      }, err => {
        paymentResponse.complete("fail");
      });
    }).catch(err => {
      console.error("Uh oh, something bad happened", err.message);
    });


<div class="attempt-left">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/8_card_verified.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

The [`complete()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#complete) method tells
the user agent that the user interaction is over and allows the app to notify
the user of the result and to address the disposition of any remaining UI
elements.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

    paymentResponse.complete('success').then(() => {
      // Success UI
    }

    paymentResponse.complete('fail').then(() => {
      // Error UI
    };


*PaymentRequest complete method*

## Collecting a shipping address {: #shipping-address }

<div class="attempt-left">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/5_9_payment_request_ui.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

If you are a merchant selling physical goods, you may want to collect the user's
shipping address using the Payment Request API. This is accomplished by adding
`requestShipping: true` to the `options` parameter. With this parameter set,
"Shipping" will be added to the UI, and users can select from a list of stored
addresses or add a new shipping address.

You can alternatively use "Delivery" or "Pickup" instead of "Shipping" in the UI
by specifying `shippingType`. This is solely for display purposes.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

Note: <code><a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetails-dictionary"
target="_blank">details</a>.shippingOptions</code> need to be
<code>undefined</code> or an empty array upon initialization in order to receive
<code>shippingaddresschange</code> event. Otherwise, the event won't be fired.


    var options = {
      requestShipping: true,
      shippingType: "shipping" // "shipping"(default), "delivery" or "pickup"
    };

    var request = new PaymentRequest(methodData, details, options);


*Transaction options*

<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/9.5_address_rejected.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Shipping options can be dynamically calculated whenever a user selects or adds a
new shipping address. You can add an event listener for the
`shippingaddresschange` event, which fires on user selection of a shipping
address. You can then validate the ability to ship to that address, calculate
shipping options, and update your
[`details`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetails-dictionary)`shippingOptions`
with the new shipping options and pricing information. You can offer a default
shipping option by setting `selected` to `true` on an option.

Beware, if you specify `requestShipping: true`, then you must define an event
listener for the `shippingaddresschange` event, even if the shipping price does
not change based on the address. Ignoring the event will **eventually abort the
payment** even if you are not making any changes.

In order to reject an address for reasons such as non-supported region, pass
`details.shippingOptions` an empty array. The UI will tell the user that the
selected address is not available for shipping.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

Note: Resolving <code>shippingaddresschange</code> event and leaving
<code>details.shippingOptions</code> as an empty array also means address
rejection (in other words you cannot ship to that location). Always make sure
your shipping options are up-to-date and match whatever address the user
provided.


    request.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', e => {
      e.updateWith(((details, addr) => {
        if (addr.country === 'US') {
          var shippingOption = {
            id: '',
            label: '',
            amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '0.00'},
            selected: true
          };
          if (addr.region === 'US') {
            shippingOption.id = 'us';
            shippingOption.label = 'Standard shipping in US';
            shippingOption.amount.value = '0.00';
            details.total.amount.value = '55.00';
          } else {
            shippingOption.id = 'others';
            shippingOption.label = 'International shipping';
            shippingOption.amount.value = '10.00';
            details.total.amount.value = '65.00';
          }
          if (details.displayItems.length === 2) {
            details.displayItems.splice(1, 0, shippingOption);
          } else {
            details.displayItems.splice(1, 1, shippingOption);
          }
          details.shippingOptions = [shippingOption];
        } else {
          details.shippingOptions = [];
        }
        return Promise.resolve(details);
      })(details, request.shippingAddress));
    });



<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/10_shipping_address.png" >
    <figcaption>Payment Request Interface</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Upon user approval for a payment request, the
[`show()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show) method's promise
resolves. The app may use the `shippingAddress` property of the
[`PaymentResponse`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentresponse-interface)
object to inform the payment processor of the shipping address, along with other
properties.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>


    request.show().then(paymentResponse => {
      var paymentData = {
        // payment method string
        method: paymentResponse.methodName,
        // payment details as you requested
        details: paymentResponse.details.toJSON(),
        // shipping address information
        address: paymentResponse.shippingAddress.toJSON()
      };
      // Send information to the server
    });



## Adding shipping options {: #shipping-options}
If your service allows users to select shipping options such as "free",
"standard", or "express", you can also do that through Payment Request UI. To
offer such choices, add the
[`shippingOptions`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentshippingoption-dictionary)
property and its options to the `details` object. By setting one choice to
`selected: true`, the UI will render it as pre-selected (which means your total
amount should reflect the price for that shipping option).


    var details = {
      total: {label: 'Donation', amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '55.00'}},
      displayItems: [
        {
          label: 'Original donation amount',
          amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '65.00'}
        },
        {
          label: 'Friends and family discount',
          amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '-10.00'}
        }
      ],
      shippingOptions: [
        {
          id: 'standard',
          label: 'Standard shipping',
          amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '0.00'},
          selected: true
        },
        {
          id: 'express',
          label: 'Express shipping',
          amount: {currency: 'USD', value: '12.00'}
        }
      ]
    };
    var request = new PaymentRequest(methodData, details, options);


Note: As noted earlier, <code><a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetails-dictionary"
target="_blank">details</a>.shippingOptions</code> need to be
<code>undefined</code> or an empty array upon initialization in order to receive
<code>shippingaddresschange</code> event. Set this value on initialization only
when shipping options won't change based on address (such as global free
shipping).

Changing shipping options may have different prices. In order to add the
shipping fee and change the total price, you may add an event listener for the
`shippingoptionchange` event, which fires on user selection of a shipping
option, so that you can run a programmatic examination of the option data. You
may change the shipping fee depending on the shipping address as well.


    request.addEventListener('shippingoptionchange', e => {
      e.updateWith(((details, shippingOption) => {
        var selectedShippingOption;
        var otherShippingOption;
        if (shippingOption === 'standard') {
          selectedShippingOption = details.shippingOptions[0];
          otherShippingOption = details.shippingOptions[1];
          details.total.amount.value = '55.00';
        } else {
          selectedShippingOption = details.shippingOptions[1];
          otherShippingOption = details.shippingOptions[0];
          details.total.amount.value = '67.00';
        }
        if (details.displayItems.length === 2) {
          details.displayItems.splice(1, 0, selectedShippingOption);
        } else {
          details.displayItems.splice(1, 1, selectedShippingOption);
        }
        selectedShippingOption.selected = true;
        otherShippingOption.selected = false;
        return Promise.resolve(details);
      })(details, request.shippingOption));
    });

Upon user approval for a payment request, the
[`show()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show) method's promise

[`PaymentResponse`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentresponse-interface)
object to inform the payment processor of the shipping option, along with other
properties.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

    request.show().then(paymentResponse => {
      var paymentData = {

        // shipping option
        shippingOption: paymentResponse.shippingOption
      };
      // Send information to the server
    });



## Adding optional contact information {: #contact-information}
You can also collect a user's email address, phone number or name by configuring
the `options` object.


    var options = {
      requestPayerPhone: true,  // Request user's phone number
      requestPayerEmail: true,  // Request user's email address
      requestPayerName:  true   // Request user's name

properties of the
[`PaymentResponse`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentresponse-interface)
object to inform the payment processor of the user choice, along with other

## Making PaymentRequest a progressive enhancement {: #request-progressive}
As Payment Request API is an emerging feature, many browsers don't yet support
it. To determine whether the feature is available, query
`window.PaymentRequest`.


    if (window.PaymentRequest) {
      // PaymentRequest supported
      // Continue with PaymentRequest API
    } else {
      // PaymentRequest NOT supported
      // Continue with existing form based solution
    }

Note: It is best to have a normal link to the regular checkout process. Then use JavaScript to prevent the navigation if PaymentRequest is supported.


## Check payment method availability

Before calling `show()` and showing the PaymentRequest UI, you can optionally
check to see if the user has a payment method available for payment. This gives
developers more control over the final user experience they want to provide. To
do so, use `canMakePayment()`.

    // Check if `canMakePayment()` exists as older Chrome versions
    // don't support it.
    if (request.canMakePayment) {
      request.canMakePayment().then(result => {
        if (result) {
          request.show();
        } else {
          // The user doesn't have an active payment method.
          // Forwarding to legacy form based experience
          location.href = '/checkout';
        }
      }).catch(error => {
        // Unable to determine.
        request.show();
      });
    } else {
      request.show();
    }

Warning: In order to protect user privacy, calling <code>canMakePayment()</code>
too often within a short time range causes [a "Quota exceeded"
error](https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/#canmakepayment-method).

At the time of writing, the quota error will go away in Chrome after 30 minutes,
but this heuristic may change over time.

Note: Using <code>canMakePayment()</code> is optional. Without it, users can
still add a new payment method in the Payment Request UI.
