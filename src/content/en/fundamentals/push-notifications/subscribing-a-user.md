# Subscribing a User {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/mattgaunt.html" %}



The first step is to get permission from the user to send them push messages and then we can
get our hands on a `PushSubscription`.

The JavaScript API to do this is reasonably straight forward, so let's step
through the logic flow.

## Feature Detection

First we need check if the current browser actually supports push messaging. We can check if
push is supported with two simple checks.

1. Check for *serviceWorker* on *navigator*.
1. Check for *PushManager* on *window*.

    if (!('serviceWorker' in navigator)) {
      // Service Worker isn't supported on this browser, disable or hide UI.
      return;
    }

    if (!('PushManager' in window)) {
      // Push isn't supported on this browser, disable or hide UI.
      return;
    }

While browser support is growing quickly for both service worker and
push messaging support, it's always a good idea to feature detect for both and
[progressively enhance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement).

## Register a Service Worker

With the feature detect we know that both service workers and Push are supported. The next step
is to "register" our service worker.

When we register a service worker, we are telling the browser where our service worker file is.
The file is still just JavaScript, but the browser will "give it access" to the service worker
APIs, including push. To be more exact, the browser runs the file in a service worker
environment.

To register a service worker, call `navigator.serviceWorker.register()`, passing in the path to
our file. Like so:

    function registerServiceWorker() {
      return navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')
      .then(function(registration) {
        console.log('Service worker successfully registered.');
        return registration;
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        console.error('Unable to register service worker.', err);
      });
    }

This code above tells the browser that we have a service worker file and where it's located. In
this case, the service worker file is at `/service-worker.js`. Behind the scenes the browser
will take the following steps after calling `register()`:

1. Download the service worker file.

1. Run the JavaScript.

1. If everything ran correctly and there were no errors, the promise returned by `register()`
will resolve. If there are errors of any kind, the promise will reject.

> If `register()` does reject, double check your JavaScript for typos / errors in Chrome DevTools.

When `register()` does resolve, it returns a `ServiceWorkerRegistration`. We'll use this
registration to access to the [PushManager
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager).

## Requesting Permission

We've registered our service worker and are ready to subscribe the user, the next step is to get
permission from the user to send them push messages.

The API for getting permission is relatively simple, the downside is that
the API [recently changed from taking a callback to returning a
Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/requestPermission). The
problem with this, is that we can't tell what version of the API is implemented by the current
browser, so you have to implement both and handle both.

    function askPermission() {
      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        const permissionResult = Notification.requestPermission(function(result) {
          resolve(result);
        });

        if (permissionResult) {
          permissionResult.then(resolve, reject);
        }
      })
      .then(function(permissionResult) {
        if (permissionResult !== 'granted') {
          throw new Error('We weren\'t granted permission.');
        }
      });
    }

In the above code, the important snippet of code is the call to
`Notification.requestPermission()`. This method will display a prompt to the user:

![Permission Prompt on Desktop and Mobile Chrome.](./images/permission-prompt.png)

Once the permission has been accepted / allowed, closed (i.e. clicking the cross on the pop-up),
or blocked, we'll be given the result as a string: 'granted', 'default' or 'denied'.

In the sample code above, the promise returned by `askPermission()` resolves if the permission
is granted, otherwise we throw an error making the promise reject.

One edge case that you need to handle is if the user clicks the 'Block' button. If this
happens, your web app will not be able to ask the user for permission again. They'll have to
manually "unblock" your app by changing its permission state, which is buried
in a settings panel. Think carefully about how and when you ask the user for permission,
because if they click block, it's not an easy way to reverse that decision.

The good news is that most users are happy to give permission as long as
they *know* why the permission is being asked.

We'll look at how some popular sites ask for permission later on.

## Subscribe a User with PushManager

Once we have our service worker registered and we've got permission, we can subscribe a user by
calling `registration.pushManager.subscribe()`.

    function subscribeUserToPush() {
      return navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')
      .then(function(registration) {
        const subscribeOptions = {
          userVisibleOnly: true,
          applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(
            'BEl62iUYgUivxIkv69yViEuiBIa-Ib9-SkvMeAtA3LFgDzkrxZJjSgSnfckjBJuBkr3qBUYIHBQFLXYp5Nksh8U'
          )
        };

        return registration.pushManager.subscribe(subscribeOptions);
      })
      .then(function(pushSubscription) {
        console.log('Received PushSubscription: ', JSON.stringify(pushSubscription));
        return pushSubscription;
      });
    }

When calling the `subscribe()` method, we pass in an *options* object, which consists of both
required and optional parameters.

Lets look at all the options we can pass in.

### userVisibleOnly Options

When push was first added to browsers, there was uncertainty about whether developers should be
able to send a push message and not show a notification. This is commonly referred to as silent
push, due to the user not knowing that something had happened in the background.

The concern was that developers could do nasty things like track a user's location on an
ongoing basis without the user knowing.

To avoid this scenario and to give spec authors time to consider how best to support this
feature, the `userVisibleOnly` option was added and passing in a value of `true` is a symbolic
agreement with the browser that the web app will show a notification every time a push is
received (i.e. no silent push).

At the moment you **must** pass in a value of `true`. If you don't include the
`userVisibleOnly` key or pass in `false` you'll get the following error:

> Chrome currently only supports the Push API for subscriptions that will result in
user-visible messages. You can indicate this by calling
`pushManager.subscribe({userVisibleOnly: true})` instead. See
[https://goo.gl/yqv4Q4](https://goo.gl/yqv4Q4) for more details.

It's currently looking like blanket silent push will never be implemented in Chrome. Instead,
spec authors are exploring the notion of a budget API which will allow web apps a certain
number of silent push messages based on the usage of a web app.



### applicationServerKey Option

We briefly mentioned "application server keys" in the previous section. "Application
server keys" are used by a push service to identify the application subscribing a user and
ensure that the same application is messaging that user.

Application server keys are a public and private key pair that are unique to your application.
The private key should be kept a secret to your application and the public key can be shared
freely.

The `applicationServerKey` option passed into the `subscribe()` call is the application's public
key. The browser passes this onto a push service when subscribing the user, meaning the push
service can tie your application's public key to the user's `PushSubscription`.

The diagram below illustrates these steps.

1. Your web app is loaded in a browser and you call `subscribe()`, passing in your public
application server key.
1. The browser then makes a network request to a push service who will generate an endpoint,
associate this endpoint with the applications public key and return the endpoint to the
browser.
1. The browser will add this endpoint to the `PushSubscription`, which is returned via the
`subscribe()` promise.

![Illustration of the public application server key is used in subscribe
method.](./images/svgs/application-server-key-subscribe.svg)

When you later want to send a push message, you'll need to create an **Authorization** header
which will contain information signed with your application server's **private key**. When the
push service
receives a request to send a push message, it can validate this signed **Authorization** header
by looking up the public key linked to the endpoint receiving the request. If the signature is
valid the push service knows that it must have come from the application server with the
**matching private key**. It's basically a security measure that prevents anyone else sending
messages to an application's users.

![How the private application server key is used when sending a
message.](./images/svgs/application-server-key-send.svg)

Technically, the `applicationServerKey` is optional. However, the easiest
implementation on Chrome requires it, and other browsers may require it in
the future. It's optional on Firefox.

The specification that defines *what* the application server key should be is
the [VAPID spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid).
Whenever you read something referring to *"application server keys"* or
*"VAPID keys"*, just remember that they are the same thing.

#### How to Create Application Server Keys

You can create a public and private set of application server keys by visiting
[web-push-codelab.glitch.me](https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/) or you can use the
[web-push command line](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push#command-line)
to generate keys by doing the following:

    $ npm install -g web-push
    $ web-push generate-vapid-keys

You only need to create these keys once for your application, just make sure you keep the
private key private. (Yeah, I just said that.)

## Permissions and subscribe()

There is one side effect of calling `subscribe()`. If your web app doesn't have permissions for
showing notifications at the time of calling `subscribe()`, the browser will request the
permissions for you. This is useful if your UI works with this flow, but if you want more
control (and I think most developers will), stick to the `Notification.requestPermission()` API
that we used earlier.

## What is a PushSubscription?

We call `subscribe()`, pass in some options, and in return we get a promise that resolves to a
`PushSubscription` resulting in some code like so:

    function subscribeUserToPush() {
      return navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')
      .then(function(registration) {
        const subscribeOptions = {
          userVisibleOnly: true,
          applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(
            'BEl62iUYgUivxIkv69yViEuiBIa-Ib9-SkvMeAtA3LFgDzkrxZJjSgSnfckjBJuBkr3qBUYIHBQFLXYp5Nksh8U'
          )
        };

        return registration.pushManager.subscribe(subscribeOptions);
      })
      .then(function(pushSubscription) {
        console.log('Received PushSubscription: ', JSON.stringify(pushSubscription));
        return pushSubscription;
      });
    }

The `PushSubscription` object contains all the required information needed to send a push
messages to that user. If you print out the contents using `JSON.stringify()`, you'll see the
following:

    {
      "endpoint": "https://some.pushservice.com/something-unique",
      "keys": {
        "p256dh":
    "BIPUL12DLfytvTajnryr2PRdAgXS3HGKiLqndGcJGabyhHheJYlNGCeXl1dn18gSJ1WAkAPIxr4gK0_dQds4yiI=",
        "auth":"FPssNDTKnInHVndSTdbKFw=="
      }
    }

The `endpoint` is the push services URL. To trigger a push message, make a POST request
to this URL.

The `keys` object contains the values used to encrypt message data sent with a push message
(which we'll discuss later on in this section).

## Send a Subscription to Your Server

Once you have a push subscription you'll want to send it to your server. It's up to you how you
do that but a tiny tip is to use `JSON.stringify()` to get all the necessary data out of the
subscription object.  Alternatively you can piece together the same
result manually like so:

    const subscriptionObject = {
      endpoint: pushSubscription.endpoint,
      keys: {
        p256dh: pushSubscription.getKeys('p256dh'),
        auth: pushSubscription.getKeys('auth')
      }
    };

    // The above is the same output as:

    const subscriptionObjectToo = JSON.stringify(pushSubscription);

Sending the subscription is done in the web page like so:

    function sendSubscriptionToBackEnd(subscription) {
      return fetch('/api/save-subscription/', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(subscription)
      })
      .then(function(response) {
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Bad status code from server.');
        }

        return response.json();
      })
      .then(function(responseData) {
        if (!(responseData.data && responseData.data.success)) {
          throw new Error('Bad response from server.');
        }
      });
    }

The node server receives this request and saves the data to a database for use later on.

    app.post('/api/save-subscription/', function (req, res) {
      if (!isValidSaveRequest(req, res)) {
        return;
      }

      return saveSubscriptionToDatabase(req.body)
      .then(function(subscriptionId) {
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        res.send(JSON.stringify({ data: { success: true } }));
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        res.status(500);
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        res.send(JSON.stringify({
          error: {
            id: 'unable-to-save-subscription',
            message: 'The subscription was received but we were unable to save it to our database.'
          }
        }));
      });
    });

With the `PushSubscription` details on our server we are good to send our user
a message whenever we want.

## FAQs

A few common questions people have asked at this point:

> Can I change the push service a browser uses?

No. The push service is selected by the browser and as we saw with the
`subscribe()` call, the browser will make network requests to the push service
to retrieve the details that make up the *PushSubscription*.

> Each browser uses a different Push Service, don't they have different API's?

All push services will expect the same API.

This common API is called the
[Web Push Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol)
and describes the network request
your application will need to make to trigger a push message.

> If I subscribe a user on their desktop, are they subscribed on their phone
as well?

Unfortunately not. A user must register for push on each browser they wish to
receive messages on. It's also worth noting that this will require
the user granting permission on each device.
