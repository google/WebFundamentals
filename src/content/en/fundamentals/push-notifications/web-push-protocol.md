# The Web Push Protocol {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/mattgaunt.html" %}



We've seen how a library can be used to trigger push messages, but what
exactly are these libraries doing?

Well, they're making network requests while ensuring such requests are
the right format. The spec that defines this network request is the
[Web Push Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol).

![Diagram of sending a push message from your server to a push
service.](./images/svgs/server-to-push-service.svg)

This section outlines how the server can identify itself with application
server keys and how the encrypted payload and associated data is sent.

This isn't a pretty side of web push and I'm no expert at encryption, but let's look through
each piece since it's handy to know what these libraries are doing under the hood.

## Application server keys

When we subscribe a user, we pass in an `applicationServerKey`. This key is
passed to the push service and used to check that the application that subscribed
the user is also the application that is triggering push messages.

When we trigger a push message, there are a set of headers that we send that
allow the push service to authenticate the application. (This is defined
by the [VAPID spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid).)

What does all this actually mean and what exactly happens? Well these are the steps taken for
application server authentication:

1. The application server signs some JSON information with it's **private application key**.
1. This signed information is sent to the push service as a header in a POST request.
1. The push service uses the stored public key it received from
`pushManager.subscribe()` to check the received information is signed by
the private key relating to the public key. *Remember*: The public key is
the `applicationServerKey` passed into the subscribe call.
1. If the signed information is valid the push service sends the push
message to the user.

An example of this flow of information is below. (Note the legend in the bottom left to indicate
public and private keys.)

![Illustration of how the private application server key is used when sending a
message.](./images/svgs/application-server-key-send.svg)

The "signed information" added to a header in the request is a JSON Web Token.

### JSON web token

A [JSON web token](https://jwt.io/) (or JWT for short) is a way of
sending a message to a third party such that the receiver can validate
who sent it.

When a third party receives a message, they need to get the senders
public key and use it to validate the signature of the JWT. If the
signature is valid then the JWT must have been signed with the matching
private key so must be from the expected sender.

There are a host of libraries on [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) that
can perform the signing for you and I'd recommend you do that where you
can. For completeness, let's look at how to manually create a signed JWT.

### Web push and signed JWTs

A signed JWT is just a string, though it can be thought of as three strings joined
by dots.

![A illustration of the strings in a JSON Web
Token](./images/svgs/authorization-jwt-diagram-header.svg)

The first and second strings (The JWT info and JWT data) are pieces of
JSON that have been base64 encoded, meaning it's publicly readable.

The first string is information about the JWT itself, indicating which algorithm
was used to create the signature.

The JWT info for web push must contain the following information:

    {  
      "typ": "JWT",  
      "alg": "ES256"  
    }


The second string is the JWT Data. This provides information about the sender of the JWT, who
it's intended for and how long it's valid.

For web push, the data would have this format:

    {  
      "aud": "https://some-push-service.org",
      "exp": "1469618703",
      "sub": "mailto:example@web-push-book.org"  
    }


The `aud` value is the "audience", i.e. who the JWT is for. For web push the
audience is the push service, so we set it to the **origin of the push
service**.

The `exp` value is the expiration of the JWT, this prevent snoopers from being
able to re-use a JWT if they intercept it. The expiration is a timestamp in
seconds and must be no longer 24 hours.

In Node.js the expiration is set using:

    Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (12 * 60 * 60)

It's 12 hours rather than 24 hours to avoid
any issues with clock differences between the sending application and the push service.

Finally, the `sub` value needs to be either a URL or a `mailto` email address.
This is so that if a push service needed to reach out to sender, it can find
contact information from the JWT. (This is why the web-push library needed an
email address).

Just like the JWT Info, the JWT Data is encoded as a URL safe base64
string.

The third string, the signature, is the result of taking the first two strings
(the JWT Info and JWT Data), joining them with a dot character, which we'll
call the "unsigned token", and signing it.

The signing process requires encrypting the "unsigned token" using ES256. According to the [JWT
spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519), ES256 is short for "ECDSA using the P-256 curve and
the SHA-256 hash algorithm". Using web crypto you can create the signature like so:

    // Utility function for UTF-8 encoding a string to an ArrayBuffer.
    const utf8Encoder = new TextEncoder('utf-8');

    // The unsigned token is the concatenation of the URL-safe base64 encoded
    // header and body.
    const unsignedToken = .....;

    // Sign the |unsignedToken| using ES256 (SHA-256 over ECDSA).
    const key = {
      kty: 'EC',
      crv: 'P-256',
      x: window.uint8ArrayToBase64Url(
        applicationServerKeys.publicKey.subarray(1, 33)),
      y: window.uint8ArrayToBase64Url(
        applicationServerKeys.publicKey.subarray(33, 65)),
      d: window.uint8ArrayToBase64Url(applicationServerKeys.privateKey),
    };

    // Sign the |unsignedToken| with the server's private key to generate
    // the signature.
    return crypto.subtle.importKey('jwk', key, {
      name: 'ECDSA', namedCurve: 'P-256',
    }, true, ['sign'])
    .then((key) => {
      return crypto.subtle.sign({
        name: 'ECDSA',
        hash: {
          name: 'SHA-256',
        },
      }, key, utf8Encoder.encode(unsignedToken));
    })
    .then((signature) => {
      console.log('Signature: ', signature);
    });

A push service can validate a JWT using the public application server key
to decrypt the signature and make sure the decrypted string is the same
as the "unsigned token" (i.e. the first two strings in the JWT).

The signed JWT (i.e. all three strings joined by dots), is sent to the web
push service as the `Authorization` header with `WebPush ` prepended, like so:

    Authorization: 'WebPush <JWT Info>.<JWT Data>.<Signature>'

The Web Push Protocol also states the public application server key must be
sent in the `Crypto-Key` header as a URL safe base64 encoded string with
`p256ecdsa=` prepended to it.

    Crypto-Key: p256ecdsa=<URL Safe Base64 Public Application Server Key>

## The Payload Encryption

Next let's look at how we can send a payload with a push message so that when our web app
receives a push message, it can access the data it receives.

A common question that arises from any who've used other push services is why does the web push
payload need to be encrypted? With native apps, push messages can send data as plain text.

Part of the beauty of web push is that because all push services use the
same API (the web push protocol), developers don't have to care who the
push service is. We can make a request in the right format and expect a
push message to be sent. The downside of this is that developers could
conceivably send messages to a push service that isn't trustworthy. By
encrypting the payload, a push service can't read the data that's sent.
Only the browser can decrypt the information. This protects the user's
data.

The encryption of the payload is defined in the [Message Encryption
spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-encryption).

Before we look at the specific steps to encrypt a push messages payload,
we should cover some techniques that'll be used during the encryption
process. (Massive hat tip to Mat Scales for his excellent article on push
encryption.)

### ECDH and HKDF

Both ECDH and HKDF are used throughout the encryption process and offer benefits for the
purpose of encrypting information.

#### ECDH: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange

Imagine you have two people who want to share information, Alice and Bob.
Both Alice and Bob have their own public and private keys. Alice and Bob
share their public keys with each other.

The useful property of keys generated with ECDH is that Alice can use her
private key and Bob's public key to create secret value 'X'. Bob can do
the same, taking his private key and Alice's public key to
independently create the same value 'X'. This makes 'X' a shared secret
and Alice and Bob only had to share their public key. Now Bob and Alice
can use 'X' to encrypt and decrypt messages between them.

ECDH, to the best of my knowledge, defines the properties of curves which allow this "feature"
of making a shared secret 'X'.

This is a high level explanation of ECDH, if you want to learn more [I recommend checking out
this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3zzNa42-tQ).

In terms of code; most languages / platforms come with libraries to make it
easy to generate these keys.

In node we'd do the following:

    const keyCurve = crypto.createECDH('prime256v1');
    keyCurve.generateKeys();

    const publicKey = keyCurve.getPublicKey();
    const privateKey = keyCurve.getPrivateKey();

#### HKDF: HMAC based key derivation function

Wikipedia has a succinct description of [HKDF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869):

> HKDF is an HMAC based key derivation function that transforms any weak key
> material into cryptographically strong key material. It can be used, for
> example, to convert Diffie Hellman exchanged shared secrets into key material
> suitable for use in encryption, integrity checking or authentication.
>
> -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF)

Essentially, HKDF will take input that is not particular secure and make it more secure.

The spec defining this encryption requires use of SHA-256 as our hash algorithm
and the resulting keys for HKDF in web push should be no longer than 256 bits
(32 bytes).

In node this could be implemented like so:

    // Simplified HKDF, returning keys up to 32 bytes long
    function hkdf(salt, ikm, info, length) {
      // Extract
      const keyHmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', salt);
      keyHmac.update(ikm);
      const key = keyHmac.digest();

      // Expand
      const infoHmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', key);
      infoHmac.update(info);

      // A one byte long buffer containing only 0x01
      const ONE_BUFFER = new Buffer(1).fill(1);
      infoHmac.update(ONE_BUFFER);

      return infoHmac.digest().slice(0, length);
    }

Hat tip to [Mat Scale's article for this example code](/web/updates/2016/03/web-push-encryption).

This loosely covers [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)
and [HKDF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869).

ECDH a secure way to share public keys and generate a shared secret. HKDF is a way to take
insecure material and make it secure.

This will be used during the encryption of our payload. Next let's look at what we take as
input and how that's encrypted.

### Inputs

When we want to send a push message to a user with a payload, there are three inputs we need:

1. The payload itself.
1. The `auth` secret from the `PushSubscription`.
1. The `p256dh` key from the `PushSubscription`.

We've seen the `auth` and `p256dh` values being retrieved from a `PushSubscription` but for a
quick reminder, given a subscription we'd need these values:

    subscription.joJSON().keys.auth
    subscription.joJSON().keys.p256dh

    subscription.getKey('auth')
    subscription.getKey('p256dh')

The `auth` value should be treated as a secret and not shared outside of your application.

The `p256dh` key is a public key, this is sometimes referred to as the client public key. Here
we'll refer to `p256dh` as the subscription public key. The subscription public key is generated
by the browser. The browser will keep the private key secret and use it for decrypting the
payload.

These three values, `auth`, `p256dh` and `payload` are needed as inputs and the result of the
encryption process will be the encrypted payload, a salt value and a public key used just for
encrypting the data.

**Salt**

The salt needs to be 16 bytes of random data. In NodeJS, we'd do the following to create a salt:

    const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16);

**Public / Private Keys**

The public and private keys should be generated using a P-256 elliptic curve,
which we'd do in Node like so:

    const localKeysCurve = crypto.createECDH('prime256v1');
    localKeysCurve.generateKeys();

    const localPublicKey = localKeysCurve.getPublicKey();
    const localPrivateKey = localKeysCurve.getPrivateKey();

We'll refer to these keys as "local keys". They are used *just* for encryption and have
*nothing* to do with application server keys.

With the payload, auth secret and subscription public key as inputs and with a newly generated
salt and set of local keys, we are ready to actually do some encryption.

### Shared secret

The first step is to create a shared secret using the subscription public key and our new
private key (remember the ECDH explanation with Alice and Bob? Just like that).

    const sharedSecret = localKeysCurve.computeSecret(
      subscription.keys.p256dh, 'base64');

This is used in the next step to calculate the Pseudo Random Key (PRK).

### Pseudo random key

The Pseudo Random Key (PRK) is the combination of the push subscription's auth
secret, and the shared secret we just created.

    const authEncBuff = new Buffer('Content-Encoding: auth\0', 'utf8');
    const prk = hkdf(subscription.keys.auth, sharedSecret, authEncBuff, 32);

You might be wondering what the `Content-Encoding: auth\0` string is for.
In short, it doesn't have a clear purpose, although browsers could
decrypt an incoming message and look for the expected content-encoding.
The `\0` adds a byte with a value of 0 to end of the Buffer. This is
expected by browsers decrypting the message who will expect so many bytes
for the content encoding, followed a byte with value 0, followed by the
encrypted data.

Our Pseudo Random Key is simply running the auth, shared secret and a piece of encoding info
through HKDF (i.e. making it cryptographically stronger).

### Context

The "context" is a set of bytes that is used to calculate two values later on in the encryption
browser. It's essentially an array of bytes containing the subscription public key and the
local public key.

    const keyLabel = new Buffer('P-256\0', 'utf8');

    // Convert subscription public key into a buffer.
    const subscriptionPubKey = new Buffer(subscription.keys.p256dh, 'base64');

    const subscriptionPubKeyLength = new Uint8Array(2);
    subscriptionPubKeyLength[0] = 0;
    subscriptionPubKeyLength[1] = subscriptionPubKey.length;

    const localPublicKeyLength = new Uint8Array(2);
    subscriptionPubKeyLength[0] = 0;
    subscriptionPubKeyLength[1] = localPublicKey.length;

    const contextBuffer = Buffer.concat([
      keyLabel,
      subscriptionPubKeyLength.buffer,
      subscriptionPubKey,
      localPublicKeyLength.buffer,
      localPublicKey,
    ]);

The final context buffer is a label, the number of bytes in the subscription public key,
followed by the key itself, then the number of bytes local public key, followed by the key
itself.

With this context value we can use it in the creation of a nonce and a content encryption key
(CEK).

### Content encryption key and nonce

A [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) is a value that prevents replay
attacks as it should only be used once.

The content encryption key (CEK) is the key that will ultimately be used to encrypt our payload.

First we need to create the bytes of data for the nonce and CEK, which is simply a content
encoding string followed by the context buffer we just calculated:

    const nonceEncBuffer = new Buffer('Content-Encoding: nonce\0', 'utf8');
    const nonceInfo = Buffer.concat([nonceEncBuffer, contextBuffer]);

    const cekEncBuffer = new Buffer('Content-Encoding: aesgcm\0');
    const cekInfo = Buffer.concat([cekEncBuffer, contextBuffer]);

This information is run through HKDF combining the salt and PRK with the nonceInfo and cekInfo:

    // The nonce should be 12 bytes long
    const nonce = hkdf(salt, prk, nonceInfo, 12);

    // The CEK should be 16 bytes long
    const contentEncryptionKey = hkdf(salt, prk, cekInfo, 16);

This gives us our nonce and content encryption key.

### Perform the encryption

Now that we have our content encryption key, we can encrypt the payload.

We create an AES128 cipher using the content encryption key
as the key and the nonce is an initialization vector.

In Node this is done like so:

    const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(
      'id-aes128-GCM', contentEncryptionKey, nonce);

Before we encrypt our payload, we need to define how much padding we wish
to add to the front of the payload. The reason we'd want to add padding
is that it prevents the risk of eavesdroppers being able to determine
"types" of messages based on the payload size.

You must add two bytes of padding to indicate the length of any additional padding.

For example, if you added no padding, you'd have two bytes with value 0, i.e. no padding exists, after these two bytes you'll be reading the payload. If you added 5 bytes of padding, the first two bytes will have a value of 5, so the consumer will then read an additional five bytes and then start reading the payload.

    const padding = new Buffer(2 + paddingLength);
    // The buffer must be only zeros, except the length
    padding.fill(0);
    padding.writeUInt16BE(paddingLength, 0);

We then run our padding and payload through this cipher.

    const result = cipher.update(Buffer.concat(padding, payload));
    cipher.final();

    // Append the auth tag to the result -
    // https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_cipher_getauthtag
    const encryptedPayload = Buffer.concat([result, cipher.getAuthTag()]);

We now have our encrypted payload. Yay!

All that remains is to determine how this payload is sent to the push service.

### Encrypted payload headers & body

To send this encrypted payload to the push service we need to define a few
different headers in our POST request.

#### Encryption header

The 'Encryption' header must contain the *salt* used for encrypting the payload.

The 16 byte salt should be base64 URL safe encoded and added to the Encryption header, like so:

    Encryption: salt=<URL Safe Base64 Encoded Salt>

#### Crypto-Key header

We saw that the `Crypto-Key` header is used under the 'Application Server Keys'
section to contain the public application server key.

This header is also used to share the local public key used to encrypt
the payload.

The resulting header looks like this:

    Crypto-Key: dh=<URL Safe Base64 Encoded Local Public Key String>; p256ecdsa=<URL Safe Base64
    Encoded Public Application Server Key>

#### Content type, length & encoding headers

The `Content-Length` header is the number of bytes in the encrypted
payload. 'Content-Type' and 'Content-Encoding' headers are fixed values.
This is shown below.

    Content-Length: <Number of Bytes in Encrypted Payload>
    Content-Type: 'application/octet-stream'
    Content-Encoding: 'aesgcm'

With these headers set, we need to send the encrypted payload as the body
of our request. Notice that the `Content-Type` is set to
`application/octet-stream`. This is because the encrypted payload must be
sent as a stream of bytes.

In NodeJS we would do this like so:

    const pushRequest = https.request(httpsOptions, function(pushResponse) {
    pushRequest.write(encryptedPayload);
    pushRequest.end();

## More headers?

We've covered the headers used for JWT / Application Server Keys (i.e. how to identify the
application with the push service) and we've covered the headers used to send an encrypted
payload.

There are additional headers that push services use to alter the behavior of
sent messages. Some of these headers are required, while others are optional.

### TTL header

**Required**

`TTL` (or time to live) is an integer specifying the number of seconds
you want your push message to live on the push service before it's
delivered. When the `TTL` expires, the message will be removed from the
push service queue and it won't be delivered.

    TTL: <Time to live in seconds>

If you set a `TTL` of zero, the push service will attempt to deliver the
message immediately, **but** if the device can't be reached, your message
will be immediately dropped from the push service queue.

Technically a push service can reduce the `TTL` of a push message if it
wants. You can tell if this has happened by examining the `TTL` header in
the response from a push service.

##### Topic

**Optional**

Topics are strings that can be used to replace a pending messages with a
new message if they have matching topic names.

This is useful in scenarios where multiple messages are sent while a
device is offline, and you really only want a user to see the latest
message when the device is turned on.

##### Urgency

**Optional**

Urgency indicates to the push service how important a message is to the user. This
can be used by the push service to help conserve the battery life of a user's device by only
waking up for important messages when battery is low.

The header value is defined as shown below. The default
value is `normal`.

    Urgency: <very-low | low | normal | high>

### Everything together

If you have further questions about how this all works you can always see how libraries trigger
push messages on [the web-push-libs org](https://github.com/web-push-libs).

Once you have an encrypted payload, and the headers above, you just need to make a POST request
to the `endpoint` in a `PushSubscription`.

So what do we do with the response to this POST request?

### Response from push service

Once you've made a request to a push service, you need to check the status code
of the response as that'll tell you whether the request was successful
or not.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Status Code</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>201</td>
    <td>Created. The request to send a push message was received and accepted.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>429</td>
    <td>Too many requests. Meaning your application server has reached a rate
    limit with a push service. The push service should include a 'Retry-After'
    header to indicate how long before another request can be made.</td>
