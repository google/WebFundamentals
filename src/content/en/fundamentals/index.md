    sites they love and allow you to effectively re-engage them with
    customized, relevant content.

  <h2>Building Web Components</h2>
  <img src="/web/images/common/webcomponents-logo.png" class="attempt-right">
  <p>
    Web Components are a new set of standards which let you create your own
    HTML elements. You can use them to build anything, from simple UI elements,
    to entire applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because Web Components are standards based, they're designed to work in
    any environment, even if there are other CSS or JavaScript libraries being
    used on the page. This makes them easy to share amongst teams who might
    be on different stacks, but still wish to have consistent looking UI.
