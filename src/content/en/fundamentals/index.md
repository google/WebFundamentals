## Web Push Notifications, a new way to engage users {: .hide-from-toc  }

![Example Push Notification](/web/images/common/push-notification-16x9.png){: .attempt-right }

Web push notifications makes it easy to re-engage with users by
showing relevant, timely, and contextual notifications to the user, 
even when the browser is closed!

sites they love and allow you to effectively re-engage them with
customized, relevant content.

The Push API and Notification API open a whole new set of
possibilities for you to re-engage with your users.
