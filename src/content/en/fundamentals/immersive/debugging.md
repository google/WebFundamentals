## Install a WebVR Emulation Chrome DevTools Extension

Perhaps you find yourself not having a VR-capable device to test against. If that’s the case, help is at hand. Jaume Elias has created a [Chrome DevTools Extension which emulates a VR device](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil).

While it’s always preferable to test on real devices (especially for performance testing) this extension can help you quickly debug your apps.
