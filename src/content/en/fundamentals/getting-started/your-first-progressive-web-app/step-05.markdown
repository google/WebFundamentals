<p class="intro">
Choosing the right caching strategy for your data is vital and depends 
on the type of data your app presents. For example, time sensitive data like 
weather or stock quotes should be as fresh as possible, while avatar images or 
article content can be updated less frequently.

The **cache first then network** strategy is ideal for our app. It gets data 
on screen as quickly as possible, then updates that once the network has 
returned the latest data. In comparison to **network first then cache**, the user 
does not have to wait until the fetch times out to get the cached data. 

Cache first then network means we need to kick off two asynchronous requests, 
one to the cache and one to the network. Our network request with the app 
doesn't need to change much, but we need to modify the service worker to cache 
the response before returning it.

This requires the us to make two asynchronous requests, one to the cache, and 
one to the network. Under normal circumstances, the cached data will be return 
almost immediately providing the app with recent data it can use. Then, when the 
network request returns, the app will be updated using the latest data from the 
network.

## Intercept the network request and cache the response

We need to modify the service worker to intercept requests to the weather API 
and store their responses in the cache, so we can easily access them later. In 
the **cache then network** strategy, we expect the network response to be the 
'source of truth', always providing us with the most recent information. If 
it can't, it's OK to fail because we've already retrieved the latest cached 
data in our app.

In the service worker, let's add a `dataCacheName` so that we can separate our 
applications data from the App Shell. When the App Shell is updated and older 
caches are purged, our data will remain untouched, ready for a super fast load. 
Keep in mind, if your data format changes in the future, you'll need a way to 
handle that and ensure the App Shell and content stay in sync.

Add the following line to the top of your `service-worker.js` file:  
{% highlight javascript %}
var dataCacheName = 'weatherData-v1';
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we need to modify the `fetch` event handler to handle requests to the data 
API separately from other requests.

{% highlight javascript hl_lines="3 4 5 6" %}
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(e) {  
  console.log('[ServiceWorker] Fetch', e.request.url);  
  var dataUrl = 'https://publicdata-weather.firebaseio.com/';  
  if (e.request.url.indexOf(dataUrl) === 0) {  
    // Put data handler code here  
  } else {  
    e.respondWith(  
      caches.match(e.request).then(function(response) {  
        return response || fetch(e.request);  
      })  
    );  
  }  
});
{% endhighlight %}

The code intercepts the request and checks if the URL starts with the address of 
the weather API. If it does we'll use `fetch` to make the request. Once the 
response is returned, our code opens the cache, clones the response, stores 
it in the cache and finally returns the response to the original requestor. 


Next, replace `// Put data handler code here` with the code below:

{% highlight javascript %}
e.respondWith(  
  fetch(e.request)  
    .then(function(response) {  
      return caches.open(dataCacheName).then(function(cache) {  
        cache.put(e.request.url, response.clone());  
        console.log('[ServiceWorker] Fetched&Cached Data');  
        return response;  
      });  
    })  
);
{% endhighlight %}

Our app won't work offline quite yet. We've implemented caching and retrieval 
for the App Shell, but even though we're caching the data, we're still dependant 
on the network.

## Making the requests

As mentioned previously, the app needs to kick off two asynchronous requests, 
one to the cache and one to the network. The app uses the `caches` object 
available in `window` to access the cache and retrieve the latest data. This is an 
excellent example of _progressive enhancement_ as the `caches` object may not be 
available in all browsers, and if it's not the network request should still 
work.

To do this, we need to:

1. Check if the `caches` object is available in the global `window` object.
1. Request data from the cache.
    1. If the server request is still outstanding update the app with the cached 
       data.
1. Request data from the server.
    1. Save the data for quick access later.
    1. Update the app with the fresh data from the server.

First, let's add the flag we'll use to prevent the cache from updating the app 
in the rare case that the XHR responds before the cache. Add `hasRequestPending: 
false` to the `app` object. 

Next, we need to check if the `caches` object exists and request the latest data 
from it. Add the following code to `app.getForecast`, before the XHR is made:

{% highlight javascript %}
if ('caches' in window) {  
  caches.match(url).then(function(response) {  
    if (response) {  
      response.json().then(function(json) {  
        // Only update if the XHR is still pending, otherwise the XHR  
        // has already returned and provided the latest data.  
        if (app.hasRequestPending) {  
          console.log('updated from cache');  
          json.key = key;  
          json.label = label;  
          app.updateForecastCard(json);  
        }  
      });  
    }  
  });  
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we need to update the `app.hasRequestPending` flag. Before making the 
XHR, add `app.hasRequestPending = true;` and in the XHR response handler, just 
before `app.updateForecastCard(response)`, set `app.hasRequestPending = false;`

Our weather app now makes two asynchronous requests for data, one from the cache 
and one via an XHR. If there's data in the cache, it'll be returned and rendered 
extremely quickly (10s of ms) and update the card if the XHR is still 
outstanding. Then, when the XHR responds, the card will be updated with the 
freshest data direct from our weather API.  

If for some reason, the XHR responds faster than the cache, the 
`hasRequestPending` flag will prevent the cache from over writing the latest data 
from the network.

## Test it out

* In the console, you should see two events each time you refresh, one 
  indicating data was retrieved from the cache, and one that it was retrieved 
  from the network.
* The app should work completely offline now. Try stopping your development 
  server and disconnecting your network and running the app. The App Shell and 
  data should both be served from the cache.
