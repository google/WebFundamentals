You can either download all the sample code to your computer:

[Download Zip file](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/push-notifications/archive/master.zip)

...or clone the GitHub repository from the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git@github.com:GoogleChrome/push-notifications.git
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a **_push-notifications_** directory containing completed code for each step.

Create your own code in the directory named **_app_**. We'll refer to that throughout the codelab.
