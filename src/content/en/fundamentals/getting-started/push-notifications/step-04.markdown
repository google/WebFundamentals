Push notifications from a web app need a backend service to handle messaging.
Chrome currently uses [Google Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/) (GCM) for this, though the eventual goal is for Chrome and GCM to support the [Web Push Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomson-webpush-protocol/).

Other browsers are free to use other services.

For this step, you need to set up a project on the Google Developer Console.

**There are lots of steps here, but don't be put off. It's really easy to set up a project!**


## 1. Create a project

From the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
create a new project:

## 2. Select APIs for the project

From **Use Google APIs**, select **Enable and manage APIs**:

From the **Google APIs** list, select **Google Cloud Messaging**:

## 3. Get credentials

From the **API Manager** menu, select **Credentials**, click the **Create
credentials** dropdown button and select **API key**:

Click the **Browser key** button:

Give the key a name (anything you like!), leave the HTTP referrers field blank and click the **Create** button:

Get the **API key** — you'll need this later:

From the Home page, get the **Project Number** — you'll also need this later:

Congratulations!

You've now created a Google Cloud Messaging project.
