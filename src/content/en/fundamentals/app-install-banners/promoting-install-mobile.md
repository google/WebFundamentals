# Patterns for Promoting PWA Installation (mobile) {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/pjmclachlan.html" %}

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a [pattern](/web/progressive-web-apps/) for
creating app-like, instant loading, reliable and installable websites.
Although PWAs are available for all devices, including
[Desktop](/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop), this article focuses on mobile
PWA install promotion patterns.

Why would you want a user to install your app to their home screen? The
same reason you’d want a user to install your app from any app store. Users
who install are your most engaged audience. Users who install a PWA have
better engagement metrics than typical visitors, including more repeat visits,
longer time on site and higher conversion rates, often at parity with native
app users on mobile devices.

**If your PWA has use cases where it’s helpful for a user to install
your app, for example if you have users who use your app more than once a
week, you should be promoting the installation of your PWA within the web UI of
your app.**

Note: See [Add to Home Screen (Web)][a2hs-code] for the code required to
implement a PWA install promotion.

## PWA install promotion best practices

Some best practices apply no matter what promotional patterns you’re using on
your site.

1. Keep promotions outside of the flow of your user journeys. For example, in
   a PWA login page, put the call to action below the login form and submit
   button.  Disruptive use of promotional patterns reduce the usability of
   your PWA and will negatively impact your engagement metrics.
2. Include the ability to dismiss or decline the promotion. Remember the
   user’s preferences if they do this and only re-prompt if there’s a change in
   the user’s relationship with your content such as if they signed in or
   completed a purchase.
3. Combine more than one of these techniques in different parts of your PWA,
   but be careful not to overwhelm or annoy your user with install promotion.
   Remember rule #1!
4. Only show the promotion when you [detect][beforeinstallprompt-event]
   that the `beforeinstallprompt` event has been fired.

## Automatic browser promotion

  </figcaption>
</figure>

The browser already tells the user about the installability of your PWA using
a mini-infobar when your PWA passes the [installability checklist][a2hs-criteria]
on Android. The mini-infobar is only meant as a helper, and it will go away in
the future.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

Note: Starting in Chrome 76, you can
[prevent the mini-infobar from appearing][mini-infobar-control] by calling
`preventDefault` on the `beforeinstallprompt` event. If you do not call
`preventDefault`, the banner will be shown the first time a user visits your
site and it meets the [installability criteria][a2hs-criteria] on Android, and
then again after approximately 90 days.

## Application UI promotional patterns

Application UI promotional patterns can be used for almost any kind of PWA and
appear in the application UI, such as site navigation, banners, etc. As with
any other type of promotional pattern, it’s important to be aware of the
user’s context to minimize disruption of the user’s journey.

Sites which are thoughtful about when they trigger promotion UI achieve a
larger number of installs and avoid interfering with the journeys of users
who aren’t interested in installation.

### Fixed header {: #header }

This is an install button that is part of the header of your site.  Other
header content often includes site branding such as a logo and the hamburger
menu.  Headers may be `position:fixed` or not depending on your site’s
functionality and user needs.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/header.png">

When used appropriately, promoting PWA install from the header of your site
is a great way to make it easier for your most loyal customers to return to
your experience. Pixels in your PWA header are extremely valuable, so make
sure your install call to action is appropriately sized, of greater importance
than other possible header content, and unintrusive.

Make sure you:

* Evaluate the value of your installed use case for your users. Consider
  selective targeting to only present this promotion for users that are
  likely to benefit from it.
* Use precious header space efficiently. Consider what else would be helpful
  to offer your user in the header, and weigh the priority of the install
  promotion relative to other options.

### Navigation menu {: #nav }

Add an install button/promotion in a slide out navigation menu.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/nav.png">

The navigation menu is a great place for promoting the installation of your
app since users who open the menu are signaling engagement with your
experience.

Make sure you:

* Avoid disrupting important navigational content. Put the PWA install
  promotion below other menu items.
* Offer a short, relevant pitch for why the user would benefit from installing
  your PWA.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

### Landing page {: #landing }

The purpose of a landing page is to promote your products & services, so
this is one place where it can be appropriate to go large with promoting
the benefits of installing your PWA.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/landing.png">

First, explain your site’s value proposition, then let visitors know what
they’ll get from installation.

Make sure you:

* Appeal to features that will matter most to your visitors and emphasize
  keywords that might have brought them to your landing page.
* This is a landing page.  After you’ve made your value proposition clear,
  make your install promotion and call to action eye catching!
* Consider adding an install promotion within your app where users spend most
  of their time.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

### Install banner {: #banner }

A dismissible banner at the top of the page.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/banner.png">

Most users have encountered install banners in mobile experiences and are
familiar with the interactions offered by a banner. Banners should be used
carefully because they can be very disruptive to the user experience.

Make sure you:

* Wait until the user has demonstrated interest in your site before showing
  a banner.  If the user dismisses your banner, don’t show it again unless the
  user triggers a conversion event that indicates a higher level of engagement
  with your content such as a purchase on an eCommerce site or signing up for
  an account.
* Provide a brief explanation of the value of installing your PWA in the
  banner. For example, you can differentiate the install of a PWA from a
  native app by mentioning that it uses almost no storage on the user’s
  device or that it will install instantly without a store redirect.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## Inline promotional patterns

Inline promotional techniques interweave promotions with site content. This
is often more subtle than promotion in application UI, which has tradeoffs. You
want your promotion to stand out enough that interested users will notice it,
but not so much that it detracts from the quality of your user experience.

### In-feed {: #in-feed }

An in-feed install promotion appears between news articles or other lists
of information cards in your PWA.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/in-feed.png">

Your goal is to show users how to access the content they’re enjoying more
conveniently. Focus on promoting features and functionality that will be
helpful to your users.

Make sure you:

* Limit the frequency of the promotions to avoid annoying users.
* Give your users the ability to dismiss the promotions. Remember your user’s
  choice to dismiss.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

### Booking or checkout journey {: #journey }

Show an install promotion during or after a sequential journey, typical of
booking or checkout flows.  If you’re displaying the promotion after the user
has completed the journey, you can often make it more prominent since the
journey is completed.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/journey.png">

Make sure you:

* Include a relevant call to action. Which users will benefit from installing
  your app and why? How is it relevant to the journey they are currently
  undertaking?
* If your brand has unique offers for installed app users, be sure to mention
  them here.
* Keep the promotion out of the way of next steps in your journey or you
  can negatively affect your journey completion rates.  In the eCommerce
  example above, notice how the key journey call-to-action to checkout is
  above the app install promotion.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

### Sign up, sign in, or sign out flow {: #sign-up }

This promotion is a special case of the [journey](#journey) promotional
pattern where the promotion card can be a more prominent.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/sign-up.png">

These pages are usually only viewed by engaged users, where the value
proposition of your PWA has already been established.  There’s also often
not a lot of other useful content to place on these pages.  As a result,
it’s less disruptive to make a larger call-to-action as long as it’s not
in the way.

Make sure you:

* Avoid disrupting the user’s journey inside the sign up form. If it’s a
  multi-step process, you might want to wait until the user has completed
  the journey.
* Promote features most relevant to a signed up user.
* Consider adding additional install promotion within the signed-in areas
  of your app.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## What patterns should I use?

### eCommerce

Many eCommerce brands have a core group of loyal customers. These customers
want push notifications for early access to new collections and to know when
their items have shipped. They want the app on their home screen for quick
access to the catalog and a full screen experience.

Patterns that work well for eCommerce PWAs include:

* [Banner](#banner)
* [Header](#header)
* [Nav](#nav)
* [Landing](#landing)
* [In-feed](#in-feed)
* [Journey](#journey)
* [Sign-up](#sign-up)

#### Product Listing Page (PLP) or Category page {: #plp }

This is a special case of the in-feed install promotional pattern, where the
feed is products or category listings.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/plp.png">

Make sure you:

* Match the look and feel of the rest of your product listing page.
* Don’t disrupt the user’s product selection process.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

### Rich media and communications

Are you building the next social phenomenon or music streaming app? When new
users visit your PWA for the first time, inviting them to install your PWA
is a great way to bring them back.  With less storage usage than a typical
native app, your users can install your PWA and see whether your product
is right for them.

Patterns that work well for rich media and communications PWAs include:

* [Banner](#banner)
* [Header](#header)
* [Nav](#nav)
* [Landing](#landing)
* [Journey](#journey)
* [Sign-up](#sign-up)

### News

If you work on a content oriented site, chances are you have regular users
who would be interested in installing your PWA.

Patterns that work well for news and social PWAs include:

* [Banner](#banner)
* [Header](#header)
* [Nav](#nav)
* [Landing](#landing)
* [In-feed](#in-feed)
* [Journey](#journey)
* [Sign-up](#sign-up)

### Games

The modern web is a great distribution platform for games with the biggest
reach in the world.

Patterns that work well for PWA games include:

* [Banner](#banner)
* [Header](#header)
* [Nav](#nav)
* [Landing](#landing)
* [In-feed](#in-feed)
* [Journey](#journey)
* [Sign-up](#sign-up)

#### End of game

This is really just a special case of the [inline journey](#journey) UI pattern.

<img class="attempt-right"
     src="/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/images/install-promo/game-over.png">

Most casual and hyper casual games end quickly. If your users are enjoying the
game, this is a great chance to invite them to install.
