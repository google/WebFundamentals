This document set is a text-based version of part of the content covered in the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891" target="_blank">Udacity course on Accessibility</a>. Rather than a direct transcription of the video course, it is meant to be a more concise treatment of accessibility principles and practices, using the course's original content as a base.

In this course, you'll learn basic principles for accessible web development, and how to make your sites accessible &mdash; not just for people with disabilities, but for everyone. 

The course consists of an introduction, five lessons, and a brief wrap-up. 

The **Introduction** provides an overview of accessibility and the diverse range of users who benefit from it.

**Lesson 1** covers *focus* and how you can manage it in your application. 

**Lesson 2** introduces *semantics* as it applies to assistive technology.

**Lesson 3** covers semantics and landmarks as they relate to *navigation* in screen readers.

**Lesson 4** introduces *ARIA* and how to express non-native semantics with it.

**Lesson 5** covers *styling* and its importance to accessibility.

The goal is to help you write more accessible web sites so that all users can access all of your content.
