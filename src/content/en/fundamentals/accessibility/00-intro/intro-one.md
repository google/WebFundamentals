# Overview

This course is intended to help you understand how you can make your websites accessible and usable for everyone. "Accessibility" can be difficult to spell (or type, or say), but it doesn't have to be difficult to accomplish. In this course, you will see how to get some easy wins to help improve accessibility with minimal effort, how you can use what's built in to HTML to create more accessible and robust interfaces, and how to leverage some advanced techniques for creating really polished accessible experiences.

You'll see as we go that a great deal of this work will help you create interfaces that are more pleasant and easy to use for *all* users, not just those with disabilities.

Of course, many developers have only a hazy understanding of what "accessibility" means &mdash; something to do with government contracts, checklists, and screen readers, right? &mdash; and there are plenty of misconceptions floating around. For example, many developers feel that addressing accessibility will force them to choose between creating a delightful and attractive experience, and one that is clunky and ugly but "accessible".

That is, of course, not the case at all, so let's clear that up before we get into anything else. What do we mean by accessibility, and what are we here to learn about?
