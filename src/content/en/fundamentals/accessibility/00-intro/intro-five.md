Throughout this course we'll refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>, a set of guidelines and best practices put together by accessibility experts to address what "accessibility" means in a methodical way. Several countries actually mandate the use of these guidelines in their web accessibility legal requirements.

WCAG is organized around four principles often called by the acronym *POUR*:

 - **Perceivable**: Can users perceive the content? This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense, such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it.

 - **Operable**: Can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or touch screen.

 - **Understandable**: Can users understand the content? Can users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?

 - **Robust**: Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents (browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?

While WCAG provides a comprehensive overview of what it means for content to be accessible, it can also be a bit overwhelming. To help mitigate this, the <a href="http://webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAIM</a> (Web Accessibility in Mind) group has distilled the WCAG guidelines into an easy-to-follow checklist, targeted specifically for web content.

The <a href="http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist" target="_blank">WebAIM checklist</a> can give you a short, high-level summary of what you need to implement, while also linking to the underlying WCAG specification if you need an expanded definition.

With this tool in hand, you can chart a direction for your accessibility work and be confident that, as long as your project meets the outlined criteria, your users should have a positive experience accessing your content.
