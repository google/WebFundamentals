# Basics of UX {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/mustafa.html" %}

This article introduces a workflow that can help teams, products, startups and companies create a robust and meaningful process for developing a better user experience for their customers. You could use different parts of the process separately but they ideally work best as a series of steps.

This guide borrows heavily from the Design Sprint methodology that multiple teams across Google have used to troubleshoot and solve challenges such as the [Self Driving Car](https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/ "Self Driving Car"){:target="_blank" .external}  and [Project Loon](https://www.solveforx.com/loon/ "Project Loon"){:target="_blank" .external}.

### Double Diamond

This flow work is based on what we in UX circles call the double diamond, made popular by the [British Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/ "British Design Council"){:target="_blank" .external}, where your team diverges to understand an idea through research and then converges to define on the challenge, diverges to sketch it individually,  share the ideas, decide on what the best way forward, test and validate.

## Setting the stage

First thing is to start with the underlying challenge at hand and write it out like a proposal, asking yourself, “what is the problem I’m actually trying to solve?”.  The challenge statement is the brief you are setting for the project that includes your goal.

This challenge could be for an existing product feature that needs to be refined or a completely new product altogether. Whatever your task maybe, simply adjust the language to fit the goal you are trying to achieve. A statement should be tied to your team goals, focused on your audience, inspiring and concise.

These are some real life examples of products that I have worked with in the past;

* To design a system to manage the treatment and followup care of patients with clubfoot.

* Create an app that simplifies complex financial systems and pare them down to the essentials.

* To design consistent mobile app across different platforms without sacrificing the brand.

### Updating your challenge statement

Once you have written out several variations of the goal, present it to your team to get an agreed consensus. You may want to include a deadline in their too as this will help the team focus on the problem. So with the added an adjustments to the above could be;

* To design a system to manage the treatment and follow up care of children under the age of 2 with clubfoot for launch Q1 this year.
* Create a simple and easy to use financial app that allows you to buy and sell shares at the tap of the button without prior knowledge of the financial world, initial launch July 2017.
* Produce a design guide that will be flexible across multiple platforms and positions the company's brand effectively on each platform by the end of this year.

When you have finalized your challenge statement you want it displayed in a place where it is prominent so that it can be seen while you work. You will need to refer back to it constantly, perhaps even updating or modifying it throughout your project.

The next thing is to research the challenge and learn about the problem. What you need to discover is if what you and your team think is actually valid. Quite often we look at problems from our own point of view, which is dangerous as most of us in tech are actually power users and are in fact a minority of users. We are a vocal minority and can be fooled into thinking something is actually a problem when it isn’t.

## Validating the problem

There are various methods to collecting data to validate the challenge, each one depends on your team and if you have access to users. The objective here is to have a better understanding of the problem at hand.

### Internal interviews with stakeholders

<figure>

  <figcaption>Interviews with stakeholders can be informative for discovering insights across a company or team</figcaption>
</figure>

This involves you interviewing each team member and stakeholder at your company, from marketing to accounts. This will help you find what they think the real challenges are and what they think potential solutions could be. When I say solution I am not speaking about technical solutions here, but rather what would be the best case scenario and end goal for the company or product. For example using the challenges above “having our clubfoot software in 80% of medical facilities by the end of the year” would be a great goal to aim for.

One thing I would state here though, this method of validation is the least favoured as it prevents team discussion and collaboration potentially creating a siloed atmosphere in an organisation. Nevertheless it can yield some good information about the clients and the design challenge that you could otherwise miss.

### Lightning talks

<figure>
  <img src="images/lightning-talks.jpg" alt="A lightning talk is a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes.">
  <figcaption>A lightning talk is a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is similar to the above, but this time you get every stakeholder into a single room. Then you Elect 5 or 6 of those stakeholders (marketing, sales, design, accounts, research etc.) to give a talk, each focusing on the challenge from their perspective for a maximum of 10 minutes. The topics they must cover in their presentation should be;

* Goals of the business
* Challenges of the project from their point of view (these could be technical, research gathering, design creation etc..)
* User research that you have currently

Leave 5 minutes at the end for questions, with an elected person taking notes throughout. Once you are done you might want to update the challenge to reflect new learnings. The goal here is to collect a list of bullet points that can help drive forward a feature or flow that will help your achieve your products goal.

### User interviews
<figure>
  <img src="images/user-interviews.jpg" class="attempt-right" alt="User interviews are a great way to learn about a persons pain points in any given task">
  <figcaption>User interviews are a great way to learn about a persons pain points in any given task.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is perhaps the best way of finding out information about the user's journey, pain points and flow. Arrange at least 5 user interviews, more if you have access to them. The sorts of questions you ask them should include;

- How do they go about completing an existing task? For example, say you want to solve the challenge for the financial app above, you could ask them “how do you go about buying shares and stocks at the moment?”
- What do they like about this flow?
- What do they dislike about this flow?
- What similar products does the user currently use?
    *  What do they like?
    *  What do they dislike?
- If they had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process what would it be?

The idea of interviewing is to get the user to speak about the challenge they have, it is not a discussion point for you, which is why you must remain as quiet as possible. This is even true when a user stops speaking, always wait a moment as they could be gathering their thoughts. You would be surprised at how much someone will continue to speak after they have stopped for a few seconds.

Take notes throughout and if possible record the conversation to help you capture anything you might have missed. The goal is to compare the challenge to the user insights that you gather, do they align together? Is there something you have learnt that means you could update your challenge statement with?

### Ethnographic field research
<figure>
  <img src="images/field-interviews.jpg" class="attempt-right" alt="Seeing users in their natural environment is a great way to understand how they solve their own challenges">
  <figcaption>Seeing users in their natural environment is a great way to understand how they solve their own challenges.</figcaption>
</figure>
This is where you observe the user in the field, in context of where they trying to do something, like how they might do their shopping, how they travel to work, how they send SMS messages etc. The reason is in some cases people will tell you what they think you want to hear, but if you see them perform the actions and tasks on their own this can be insightful. Basically you are observing without interfering, noting things which they find easy, difficult and things may have they have missed. The learning here is to immerse yourself in the users environment to better empathize with their pain points.




This technique usually involves some work done over a longer period of time and requires a researcher to lead this part of the project. But it is perhaps the most insightful as you get to see a group of people that you are studying at in their natural environments.

### Gathering it altogether

Once you have completed a learnings phase of your project you need to take one last look at your challenge, are you on the right path? Is there anything you need to adjust? Write down all of the things you have learnt and group them into categories, these could become the basis of a feature or a flow, depending on the problem you are solving. They could also be used to update and revise the challenge.

Once you have enough feedback and insight it is time to converge and put those learning into practice and map out a project map.

## Project Map

The problem you are trying to solve is usually made up of different types of people (or players), each with a stake in the projects flow. Based on your learnings you need to list out the possible players. It could be a user type or stakeholder, for example “A doctor who treats clubfoot”, “A patient to has clubfoot”, “A carer who looks after patient” etc. Write down each player on a the left hand side of a sheet of paper or if you have access to one, on a whiteboard. Now on the right hand side of that paper or whiteboard write their end goals.

Finally starting with each player, write down the number of steps they would need to take in order to reach end end goal. For example for a “doctor who treats clubfoot” the end goal would be “cure a patient with clubfoot”, so the steps could be “register patient into the system”, “start them on medical a plan”, “create a review cycle of their medical health” and “perform medical procedure”.

  <img src="images/project-map.jpg" alt="Project maps plot out the main steps for each user or player in a flow">
  <figcaption>Project maps plot out the main steps for each user or player in a flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

This will give you a project map with the main steps in the process and is a great way to see the overview of the project without getting into specific details. It also allows others in the team to review the project map and see if it still matches the challenge statement. Later on when you will break down each step there will be more details but for now a project map will give you a higher level breakdown of the steps a user will take to complete their end goal.

## Wireframing and storyboarding

There is a method called crazy 8’s that involves folding a piece of paper twice over so that you have 8 panels. Then in each panel you draw out an idea based on all that you have learnt so far.

When coming up with these sketch ideas you need to set yourself a short amount of time, say 10 minutes for 8 sketches. If you set yourself more than 20 minutes what you find is you will start to procrastinate, go make yourself a coffee, check email, have a general chat with your team and essentially avoid doing the work. We want to set a sense of urgency in this as if forces us to work quickly and more effectively.

### Crazy 8’s

The goal here is to give yourself 10 minutes to come up with lots of ideas, each idea filling a single panel. If you are working with a team get everyone to do their own as well. This process will kick start your brain and get you thinking about the challenge. Generally the sketch will be an interface design wireframe.

From here present your ideas to your team and get them to present their ideas as well. Everyone must explain each idea that they came up with in detail and why they chose to go down a specific path. Try to reference back to the learnings as your justification as to why each idea could work. Once everyone has presented now comes the voting on ideas, each person gets two sticky dots and can vote on any idea. They can give both votes to a single idea if they really like it.

### Refine your design

Now you take the idea that got the most traction and sketch out a final idea, you can borrow from the other ideas that you heard from your colleagues as well. Give yourself another 10 minutes to complete this task. Once you are done again present the ideas to your team and vote like before.

### Storyboard the idea


<figure>
  <img src="images/storyboard.jpg" class="attempt-right" alt="The storyboard involves putting all of your sketches and ideas together into a comprehensive flow">
  <figcaption>The storyboard involves putting all of your sketches and ideas together into a comprehensive flow.</figcaption>
</figure>


Taking the concept that you have now developed its time to storyboard the different phases the design engages with a user. By this point you should have already thought about the different steps a user takes and it is quite common to incorporate one of your colleagues designs into the flow as well. You want to have a clear step by step process with some points that the user might diverge. Reference back to the Project Map to check that your design is actually fulfilling the correct goal.

## Creating a prototype



Creating a prototype is not about molding the perfect piece of code but to make something that is believable when used by someone. Tools used to create a prototype vary from person to person, some like Keynote or Powerpoint as it forces you to think of the flow and not design details. You might want to invest time into learning tools like Balsamiq, Marvel or Framer which can give you more behavioral controls.  Whatever tool you use make sure it is one that makes you focus on the flow and looks real. You need to test the prototype on real people so it needs to be as believable as possible but at the same time it shouldn’t take weeks of work to create.

<figure>
  <img src="images/prototyping.jpg"  alt="Prototypes need to be real enough to be believable">
  <figcaption>Prototypes need to be real enough to be believable.</figcaption>
</figure>

Creating a prototype is a balance between these two factors, time and realness, so be careful not to sway to much into each extreme, spending not enough time will make it less believable making testing hard versus trying to recreate an app in a prototyping tool that means you end up wasting too much time.

## Usability test your designs



IF you have a testing lab than that is great, if not creating one is not too hard you just have to be mindful of creating a comfortable environment for your users that is not distracting. Testing usually involves the user and two people from your team, one taking notes and the other asking questions. A good set up is to use an app like Hangouts and record their actions, this is also handy if you want the rest of the team to observe from a different room. This can be quite scary for us as app makers to do as we are seeing our designs out in the wild, which is actually refreshing and sobering experience.

  <figcaption>The storyboard involves putting all of your sketches and ideas together into a comprehensive flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Questions to ask

Ask the user to perform tasks in your app and get them to speak aloud and verbalize what is they are doing and why. This is an odd thing to do but it helps you hear what they are thinking. Try not to interrupt or tell them what they should actually do in the flow if they are getting something wrong. Simply ask them why they took a particular flow after they have completed (or NOT completed) and take notes.

What you need to find out is;

- What do they like about the prototype?
- What do they dislike about the prototype?
- What are the pain points?
      * Why did a flow work
      * Why did a flow not work
- What would they like to improve?
- Does the overall design / flow meet their needs?

## Revisit designs & another round of testing

You have a working prototype with feedback and now it’s time to revise your designs, analyze what worked and what didn’t. Do not be afraid to create a completely new wireframe storyboard and make a new prototype, starting with a new document can help you create a better flow  rather that trying to shift things around on your existing prototype. Try not to be too precious of it because it is just a prototype.

Once you are happy with your designs you can test it again and refine it some more. In cases where the prototype didn’t hit the mark at all, well you might think the project has failed, but in actual fact it hasn’t, you have spent less development time making something that users don’t like and in the process you have learned what they do like. With design sprints we have a philosophy where you either win or you learn, so don’t beat yourself up too much if the idea didn't work as planned.

## Make it!

You have tested your ideas, the user likes them, the stakeholders are brought into the designs as they have been involved since the beginning now it's time to make the thing. By now you should have a clear goal of what needs to be made and what the priorities of the experience are. At each milestone of the project you may want to introduce usability testing to help validate your work and keeping you on track. I can’t stress how important it is to find out as much as possible before you commit to a lot of work, time and energy on something that might not be the right solution for the job.

This article should now give you a basic grounding of UX and its importance. UX isn’t something that should be looked upon as a role for a designer or researcher, it is actually the responsibility of everyone involved in a project so I would recommend you getting stuck in at every opportunity.
