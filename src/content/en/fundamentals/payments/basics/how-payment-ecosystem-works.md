Let's see how the new payment ecosystem works with Web Payments.

## The anatomy of Web Payments

_Web Payments_ comprises multiple web standards.

*   **Payment Request API:** The [Payment Request
    API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/) enables fast and easy checkouts
    through a native browser UI. It provides a consistent checkout flow while
    reducing the need for users to enter their shipping and payment information
    on every checkout. Learn how it works at high level at [How payment request
    api works](payments/basics/how-payment-request-api-works) or in detail at
    [Deep Dive into the Payment Request
    API](payments/merchant-guide/deep-dive-into-payment-request).
*   **Payment Handler API:** The [Payment Handler
    API](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/) opens up the ecosystem to
    payment providers by allowing their web-based payment applications to act as
    payment methods on merchant websites through the standard Payment Request
    API.
*   **Payment Method Identifiers:** The [Payment Method
    Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-id/) defines how strings
    (`basic-card`, `https://google.com/pay`, etc.) can be used to identify a
    payment method. Along with standardized payment method identifiers, it
    allows anyone to define their own payment method with URL-based payment
    method identifiers. Learn more at [Payment method
    basics](payments/basics/payment-method-basics).
*   **Payment Method Manifest:** The [Payment Method
    Manifest](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-manifest/) defines the
    machine-readable manifest file, known as a payment method manifest,
    describing how a payment method participates in the payment ecosystem, and
    how such files are to be used.

## How the Payment Request Process Works

There are typically four participants in an online transaction.

</figure>

1.  The Customer visits a merchant's website, adds items to a shopping cart, and
    starts the checkout flow.
1.  The Merchant needs the customer's payment credentials to process the
    transaction. They present a payment request UI to the customer using [**the
    Payment Request
    API**](/web/fundamentals/payments/basics/how-payment-request-api-works). The
    UI lists various methods of payment specified by [**the Payment Method
    Identifiers**](/web/fundamentals/payments/basics/payment-method-basics). The
    payment methods can include credit card numbers saved to the browser, or
    payment handlers like Google Pay, Samsung Pay, etc. The Merchant can
    optionally request the customer's shipping address and contact information.
1.  If the customer chooses a payment method like Google Pay, Chrome launches
    either a platform-native payment app or a web-based payment app. This step
    is completely up to the payment handler's implementation, based on **the
    Payment Method Manifest**. After the customer authorizes the payment, the
    payment handler returns a response to the Payment Request API, which relays
    it to the merchant site. (If the payment is push type such as bank
    transfers, cryptocurrencies, the payment is already processed when the
    merchant receives the response.)
1.  The merchant site sends a payment credential to a PSP to process the payment
    and initiate funds transfer. Usually, verifying the payment on the server
    side is also required.
1.  The PSP processes the payment, securely requesting a funds transfer from the
    customer's bank or credit card issuer to the merchant, and then returns a
    success or failure result to the merchant website.
1.  The merchant website notifies the customer of the success or failure of the
    transaction and displays the next step, e.g., shipping the purchased item.

## Caveat: PSP Reliance

If you are a merchant and want to accept credit card payments, PSPs are an
important link in the payment processing chain. Implementing the Payment Request
API does not obviate the need for a PSP.

Merchants usually rely on a third-party PSP to perform payment processing for
convenience and expense reasons. This is primarily because most PSPs maintain
compliance with [PCI
DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard),
an information security standard that regulates the safety of cardholder data.

Because achieving and maintaining strict PCI DSS compliance can be expensive and
difficult, most merchants find that relying on a compliant PSP avoids going
through the certification process themselves. Some large and financially robust
companies, however, obtain their own PCI DSS certification specifically to avoid
such third-party reliance.

It's especially important when you are using `basic-card` payment method which
returns a primary account number (PAN) as a payment credential, that is the
number embossed on the card. Handling one with JavaScript requires [PCI SAQ
A-EP](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2-SAQ-A_EP.pdf)
compliance.

Thus, delegating payment processing to a PCI DSS-compliant PSP both simplifies
the merchant site's requirements and ensures payment information integrity for
the customer.

If you want to use the Payment Request API but don't have bandwidth to be
compliant with PCI SAQ A-EP, some PSPs provide an SDK that uses the Payment
Request API.
