The Geolocation API lets you find out, with the user's consent, where the user
is located. This functionality could be used as part of user queries; for
example, to guide a user to a destination, or for geo-tagging user-created
content, such as marking where a photo was taken.

The Geolocation API also lets you watch where the user is and keep tabs on them as
they move around, always with the user's consent (and only while the page is open). This 
creates a lot of interesting use cases, such as integrating with backend systems to prepare an 
order for collection if the user is close by.

You need to be aware of many things when using the Geolocation API. This guide walks you through the common use cases and solutions.

Note: As of Chrome 50, the [Geolocation API will only work on secure contexts (HTTPS)](/web/updates/2016/04/geolocation-on-secure-contexts-only). If your site is hosted on a non-secure origin (such as `HTTP`), the requests to get the user's location **no longer** function.

## TL;DR

* Use geolocation when it benefits the user.
* Ask for permission as a clear response to a user gesture. 
* Use feature detection in case a user's browser doesn't support geolocation.
* Don't just learn how to implement geolcation; learn the best way to use geolocation.
* Test geolcation with your site.

## When to use geolocation

*  Find where the user is closest to a physical location of yours to tailor 
   the user experience.
*  Tailor information (such as news) to the user's location.
*  Show the position of a user on a map.
*  Tag data created inside your application with the user's location 
   (that is, geo-tagging a picture).

## Ask permission responsibly

Recent user studies [have shown](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/intl/ALL_ALL/think/multiscreen/pdf/multi-screen-moblie-whitepaper_research-studies.pdf)
that users are distrustful of sites that simply prompt the user to give away their
position on page load. So what are the best practices?

### Assume users will not give you their location

Many of your users will not want to give you their
location, so you need to adopt a defensive development style.

1.  Handle all errors out of the geolocation API so that you can adapt your
    site to this condition.
2.  Be clear and explicit about your need for the location.
3.  Use a fallback solution if needed.

### Use a fallback if geolocation is required

We recommend that your site or application not require
access to the user's current location. However, if your site or application
requires the user's current location, there are third-party solutions that allow you to obtain
a best guess of where the person currently is.

These solutions often work by looking at the user's IP address and mapping that
to the physical addresses registered with the RIPE database. These locations
are often not very accurate, normally giving you a position of the nearest
telecommunications hub to the user, or the nearest cell phone tower. In many
cases, they might not even be that accurate, especially if the user is on VPN
or some other proxy service.

### Always request access to location on a user gesture

Make sure that users understand why you’re asking for their location, and what
the benefit to them will be. Asking for it immediately on the homepage as 
the site loads results in a poor user experience.

<div class="attempt-left">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/sw-navigation-good.png">
    <figcaption class="success">
      <b>DO</b>: Always request access to location on a user gesture.
     </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure id="fig1">
    <img src="images/sw-navigation-bad.png">
    <figcaption class="warning">
      <b>DON'T</b>: Ask for it immediately on the homepage as the site loads; it results in a poor user experience.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

Instead, give the user a clear call to action or an indication that
an operation will require access to their location. The user will then be able
to more easily associate the system prompt for access with the action
just initiated.

### Give a clear indication that an action will request their location

[In a study by the Google Ads team](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/intl/ALL_ALL/think/multiscreen/pdf/multi-screen-moblie-whitepaper_research-studies.pdf),
when a user was asked to book a hotel room in Boston for an upcoming conference
on one particular hotels site, they were prompted to share their GPS location
immediately after tapping the "Find and Book" call to action on the homepage.

In some cases, the user became frustrated because they didn't understand why
they were being shown hotels in San Francisco when they wanted to book a room in
Boston.

A better experience is to make sure users understand why you’re asking
them for their location. Add in a well-known signifier that is common across
devices, such as a range finder, or an explicit call to action, such as 
“Find Near Me.”

<div class="attempt-left">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/indication.png">

    <figcaption>
      A specific call to action to find near me  
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

### Gently nudge users to grant permission to their location

You don't have access to any of the steps of what users are doing. You know
exactly when the users disallow access to their location, but you don't know
when they grant you access; you only know you obtained access when results
appear.

It's a good practice to "nudge" the user into action if you need them to
complete the action.

We recommend: 

1.  Set up a timer that will trigger after a short period; 5 seconds is a
    good value.
2.  If you get an error message, show a message to the user.
3.  If you get a positive response, disable the timer and process the results.
4.  If after the timeout you haven't gotten a positive response, show a
    notification to the user.
5.  If the response comes in later and the notification is still present,
    remove it from the screen.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

    button.onclick = function() {
      var startPos;
      var element = document.getElementById("nudge");

      var showNudgeBanner = function() {
        nudge.style.display = "block";
      };

      var hideNudgeBanner = function() {
        nudge.style.display = "none";
      };

      var nudgeTimeoutId = setTimeout(showNudgeBanner, 5000);

      var geoSuccess = function(position) {
        hideNudgeBanner();
        // We have the location, don't display banner
        clearTimeout(nudgeTimeoutId); 

        // Do magic with location
        startPos = position;
        document.getElementById('startLat').innerHTML = startPos.coords.latitude;
        document.getElementById('startLon').innerHTML = startPos.coords.longitude;
      };
      var geoError = function(error) {
        switch(error.code) {
          case error.TIMEOUT:
            // The user didn't accept the callout
            showNudgeBanner();
            break;
      };

      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);
    };

## Browser support

The Geolocation API is now supported in the majority of browsers, but it's a
good practice to always check for support before you do anything.

You can easily check for compatibility by testing for the presence of the
geolocation object:

    // check for Geolocation support
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
      console.log('Geolocation is supported!');
    }
    else {
      console.log('Geolocation is not supported for this Browser/OS.');
    }


## Determining the user's current location

The Geolocation API offers a simple "one-shot" method to obtain the user's
location: `getCurrentPosition()`. A call to this method will asynchronously
report on the user's current location.

    window.onload = function() {
      var startPos;
      var geoSuccess = function(position) {
        startPos = position;
        document.getElementById('startLat').innerHTML = startPos.coords.latitude;
        document.getElementById('startLon').innerHTML = startPos.coords.longitude;
      };
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess);
    };


If this is the first time that an application on this domain has requested
permissions, the browser will typically check for user consent. Depending on
the browser, there may also be preferences to always allow&mdash;or disallow&mdash;permission lookups, in which case the confirmation process will be bypassed.

Depending on the location device your browser is using, the position object
might actually contain a lot more than just latitude and longitude; for
example, it might include an altitude or a direction. You can't tell what
extra information that location system will use until it actually returns
the data.

## Watching the user's location

The Geolocation API allows you to obtain the user's location (with user
consent) with a single call to `getCurrentPosition()`.  

If you want to continually monitor the location of the user, the Geolocation
API has a method called `watchPosition()`. It operates in a similar way to
`getCurrentPosition()`, but it fires multiple times as the positioning
software:

1.  Gets a more accurate lock on the user.
2.  Determines that the user's position changes.
 

    var watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(function(position) {
      document.getElementById('currentLat').innerHTML = position.coords.latitude;
      document.getElementById('currentLon').innerHTML = position.coords.longitude;
    });

### When to use geolocation to watch the user's location

*  You want to obtain a more precise lock on the user location.
*  Your application needs to update the user interface based on new location 
   information.
*  Your application needs to update business logic when the user enters a certain
   defined zone.


## Best practices when using geolocation

### Always clear up and conserve battery

Watching for changes to a geolocation is not a free operation. While
operating systems might be introducing platform features to let applications
hook in to the geo subsystem, you as a web developer have no idea what support
the user's device has for monitoring the user's location, and, while you're watching
a position, you are engaging the device in a lot of extra processing.

After you no longer need to track the user's position, call `clearWatch` to turn
off the geolocation systems.

###  Handle errors gracefully

Unfortunately, not all location lookups are successful. Perhaps a GPS could
not be located or the user has suddenly disabled location lookups. A second,
optional, argument to `getCurrentPosition()` will be called in the event of an
error so that you can notify the user inside the callback:

    window.onload = function() {
      var startPos;
      var geoSuccess = function(position) {
        startPos = position;
        document.getElementById('startLat').innerHTML = startPos.coords.latitude;
        document.getElementById('startLon').innerHTML = startPos.coords.longitude;
      };
      var geoError = function(error) {
        console.log('Error occurred. Error code: ' + error.code);
        // error.code can be:
        //   0: unknown error
        //   1: permission denied
        //   2: position unavailable (error response from location provider)
        //   3: timed out
      };
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);
    };


### Reduce the need to start geolocation hardware

For many use cases, you don't need to use the most up-to-date location of the user;
you just need a rough estimate.

Use the `maximumAge` optional property to tell the browser to use a recently
obtained geolocation result. This not only returns more quickly if the user has
requested the data before, but it also stops the browser from having to start
its geolocation hardware interfaces, such as Wifi triangulation or the GPS.

    window.onload = function() {
      var startPos;
      var geoOptions = {
        maximumAge: 5 * 60 * 1000,
      }

      var geoSuccess = function(position) {
        startPos = position;
        document.getElementById('startLat').innerHTML = startPos.coords.latitude;
        document.getElementById('startLon').innerHTML = startPos.coords.longitude;
      };
      var geoError = function(position) {
        console.log('Error occurred. Error code: ' + error.code);
        // error.code can be:
        //   0: unknown error
        //   1: permission denied
        //   2: position unavailable (error response from location provider)
        //   3: timed out
      };

      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError, geoOptions);
    };


### Don't keep the user waiting, set a timeout

Unless you set a timeout, your request to get the current position might never return.


    window.onload = function() {
      var startPos;
      var geoOptions = {
         timeout: 10 * 1000
      }

      var geoSuccess = function(position) {
        startPos = position;
        document.getElementById('startLat').innerHTML = startPos.coords.latitude;
        document.getElementById('startLon').innerHTML = startPos.coords.longitude;
      };
      var geoError = function(error) {
        console.log('Error occurred. Error code: ' + error.code);
        // error.code can be:
        //   0: unknown error
        //   1: permission denied
        //   2: position unavailable (error response from location provider)
        //   3: timed out
      };

      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError, geoOptions);
    };


### Prefer a coarse location over a fine-grained location

If you want to find the nearest store to a user, it's unlikely that you need
1-meter precision to work that out. The API is designed to give a coarse 
location that returns as quickly as possible.

If you do need a high level of precision, it's possible to override the default setting
with the `enableHighAccuracy` option. Use this sparingly: it will be slower
to resolve and use more battery.

    window.onload = function() {
      var startPos;
      var geoOptions = {
        enableHighAccuracy: true
      }

      var geoSuccess = function(position) {
        startPos = position;
        document.getElementById('startLat').innerHTML = startPos.coords.latitude;
        document.getElementById('startLon').innerHTML = startPos.coords.longitude;
      };
      var geoError = function(error) {
        console.log('Error occurred. Error code: ' + error.code);
        // error.code can be:
        //   0: unknown error
        //   1: permission denied
        //   2: position unavailable (error response from location provider)
        //   3: timed out
      };

      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError, geoOptions);
    };


## Testing geolocation with your site

<div class="attempt-right">
  <figure id="fig1">
    <img src="images/emulategeolocation.png" class="screenshot">
  </figure>
</div>

When working with HTML5 geolocation support in an application, it can be
useful to debug the output received when using different values for longitude
and latitude.

The DevTools support both overriding position values for navigator.geolocation
and simulating geolocation not being available via the overrides menu.

1. Open up the overrides menu in the DevTools.
2. Check “Override Geolocation”, then enter Lat = 41.4949819 and Lon = -0.1461206.
3. Refresh the page, and it will now use your overridden positions for geolocation.
