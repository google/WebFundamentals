  tldr:
    - Users must first allow push messages as a global permissions setting.
    - Users must also explicitly subscribe to your site to receive notifications.
    - You can unsubscribe users at their request, regardless of their global notifications permissions.

  Push messages may consist of breaking news, site updates, or other 
  information of interest to the user. The information is pushed from the 
  server to a service worker before it is sent to the user as a notification.

## Subscribe 

To receive messages, users must allow your web site to push notificaton 
messages to them. This is a two-step process performed on the receiving 
device, comprising of enabling of push notifications and an explicit 
subscription request to a specific web site. Both of these conditions must 
be met for the user to receive push messages; that is, a status of either 
"disabled" or "enabled but not subscribed" prevents messages from 
being received.

Push messages are implemented via a [service worker](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/).
When a push message is received, the browser can start up a service worker 
that runs in the background without a page being open. The service worker 
must be initialized and registered in order to process push messages. 

{% highlight javascript %}
// Check that service workers are supported
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {  
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')  
    .then(initialiseState);  
  } else {  
    console.warn('Service workers aren\'t supported in this browser.');  
}
{% endhighlight %}

Users expect a simple UI to enable or disable push messages for your site. 
This is typically accomplished via a UI element such as a button or toggle 
switch that enables or disables push messages and clearly indicates its 
state. For example:

![Push UX](images/pushux.png)

When the user requests a subscription activation, your web page must 
subscribe the user to your push service so they can receive messages.

{% highlight javascript %}
function subscribe() {
  // Disable the button so it can't be changed while
  //   we process the permission request
  var pushButton = document.querySelector('.js-push-button');
  pushButton.disabled = true;

  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(serviceWorkerRegistration) {
    serviceWorkerRegistration.pushManager.subscribe({userVisibleOnly: true})
      .then(function(subscription) {
        // The subscription was successful
        isPushEnabled = true;
        pushButton.textContent = 'Disable Push Messages';
        pushButton.disabled = false;

        // TODO: Send the subscription subscription.endpoint
        // to your server and save it to send a push message
        // at a later date
        return sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);
      })
      .catch(function(e) {
        if (Notification.permission === 'denied') {
          // The user denied the notification permission which
          // means we failed to subscribe and the user will need
          // to manually change the notification permission to
          // subscribe to push messages
          window.Demo.debug.log('Permission for Notifications was denied');
          pushButton.disabled = true;
        } else {
          // A problem occurred with the subscription, this can
          // often be down to an issue or lack of the gcm_sender_id
          // and / or gcm_user_visible_only
          window.Demo.debug.log('Unable to subscribe to push.', e);
          pushButton.disabled = false;
          pushButton.textContent = 'Enable Push Messages';
        }
    });
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Unsubscribe

Likewise, users can refuse push messages, either by unsubscribing to a 
specific site or by disabling push notifications completely. Your page has 
no control over their global enable/disable setting, but you should 
unsubscribe users when they request it.

{% highlight javascript %}
function unsubscribe() {  
  var pushButton = document.querySelector('.js-push-button');  
  pushButton.disabled = true;

  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(serviceWorkerRegistration) {  
    // To unsubscribe from push messaging, you need get the  
    // subscription object, which you can call unsubscribe() on.  
    serviceWorkerRegistration.pushManager.getSubscription()
      .then(function(pushSubscription) {  
        // Check we have a subscription to unsubscribe  
        if (!pushSubscription) {  
          // No subscription object, so set the state  
          // to allow the user to subscribe to push  
          isPushEnabled = false;  
          pushButton.disabled = false;  
          pushButton.textContent = 'Enable Push Messages';  
          return;  
        }  

        // TODO: Make a request to your server to remove
        // the users data from your data store so you
        // don't attempt to send them push messages anymore

        // We have a subscription, so call unsubscribe on it  
        pushSubscription.unsubscribe()
          .then(function(successful) {  
            pushButton.disabled = false;  
            pushButton.textContent = 'Enable Push Messages';  
            isPushEnabled = false;  
          }).catch(function(e) {  
            // We failed to unsubscribe, this can lead to  
            // an unusual state, so may be best to remove   
            // the users data from your data store and   
            // inform the user that you have done so

            console.log('Unsubscription error: ', e);  
            pushButton.disabled = false;
            pushButton.textContent = 'Enable Push Messages'; 
          });  
      }).catch(function(e) {  
        console.error('Error thrown while unsubscribing from push messaging.', e);  
      });  
  });  
}
{% endhighlight %}
