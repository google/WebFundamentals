{% include "web/_shared/contributors/jeffposnick.html" %}

Adding a [service
worker](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) to your web
app can offer significant performance benefits, going beyond what's possible
even when following all the [traditional browser caching best
practices](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching).
But there are a few best practices to follow in order to optimize your load
times. The following tips will ensure you're getting the best performance out of
your service worker implementation.

## First, what are navigation requests?

Navigation requests are (tersely) defined in the [Fetch
specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request) as: <em>A
navigation [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) is a
request whose
[destination](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination) is
"<code>document</code>".</em> While technically correct, that definition lacks
nuance, and it undersells the importance of navigations on your web app's
performance. Colloquially, a navigation request takes place whenever you enter a
URL in your browser's location bar, interact with
<code>[window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location)</code>,
or visit a link from one web page to another. Putting an `<iframe>`
on a page will also lead to a navigation request for the `<iframe>`'s `src`.

Note: [Single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application),
relying on the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)
and in-place DOM modifications, tend to avoid navigation requests when switching
from view to view. But the initial request in a browser's session for a
single page app is still a navigation.

While your web app might make many other [subresource
requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#subresource-request) in order to
display all its contents—for elements like scripts, images, or styles—it's the
HTML in the navigation response that's responsible for kicking off all the other
requests. Any delays in the response for the initial navigation request will be
painfully obvious to your users, as they're left staring at a blank screen for
an indeterminate period of time.

Note: [HTTP/2 server push](/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/#server_push)
adds a wrinkle here, as it allows subresource responses to be returned without
additional latency, alongside the navigation response. But any delays in
establishing the connection to the remote server will also lead to delays the
data being pushed down to the client.

Traditional [caching best
practices](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#top_of_page),
the kind that rely on HTTP `Cache-Control` headers and not a service worker,
require [going to the network each
navigation](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#invalidating_and_updating_cached_responses),
to ensure that all of the subresource URLs are fresh. The holy grail for web
performance is to get all the benefits of aggressively cached subresources,
*without* requiring a navigation request that's dependent on the network. With a
properly configured service worker tailored to your site's specific
architecture, that's now possible.

## For best performance, bypass the network for navigations

The biggest impact of adding a service worker to your web application comes from
responding to navigation requests without waiting on the network. The
best-case-scenario for connecting to a web server is likely to take orders of
magnitude longer than it would take to read locally cached data. In scenarios
where a client's connection is less than ideal—basically, anything on a mobile
network—the amount of time it takes to get back the first byte of data from the
network can easily outweigh the total time it would take to render the full
HTML.

Choosing the right cache-first service worker implementation largely depends on
your site's architecture.

### Streaming composite responses

If your HTML can naturally be split into smaller pieces, with a static header
and footer along with a middle portion that varies depending on the request URL,
then handling navigations using a streamed response is ideal. You can compose
the response out of individual pieces that are each cached separately. Using
streams ensures that the initial portion of the response is exposed to the
client as soon as possible, giving it a head start on parsing the HTML and
making any additional subresource requests.

The "[Stream Your Way to Immediate Responses](/web/updates/2016/06/sw-readablestreams)"
article provides a basic overview of this approach, but for real-world examples
and demos, Jake Archibald's "[2016 - the year of web streams](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streams-ftw/)"
is the definitive guide.

Note: For some web apps, there's no avoiding the network when responding to
a navigation request. Maybe the HTML for each URL on your site depends on data
from a content management system, or maybe your site uses varying layouts and
doesn't fit into a generic, application shell structure. Service workers still
open the door for improvements over the *status quo* for loading your HTML.
Using streams, you can respond to navigation requests immediately with a
common, cached chunk of HTML—perhaps your site's full `<head>` and some initial
`<body>` elements—while still loading the rest of the HTML, specific to a given
URL, from the network.

### Caching static HTML

If you've got a simple web app that relies entirely on a set of static HTML
documents, then you're in luck: your path to avoiding the network is
straightforward. You need a service worker that responds to navigations with
previously cached HTML, and that also includes non-blocking logic for keeping
that HTML up-to-date as your site evolves.

One approach is to use a service worker `fetch` handler that implements a
[stale-while-revalidate policy](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#stale-while-revalidate)
for navigation requests, like so:

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  if (event.request.mode === 'navigate') {
    // See /web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/async-functions
    // for an async/await primer.
    event.respondWith(async function() {
      // Optional: Normalize the incoming URL by removing query parameters.
      // Instead of https://example.com/page?key=value,
      // use https://example.com/page when reading and writing to the cache.
      // For static HTML documents, it's unlikely your query parameters will
      // affect the HTML returned. But if you do use query parameters that
      // uniquely determine your HTML, modify this code to retain them.
      const normalizedUrl = new URL(event.request.url);
      normalizedUrl.search = '';

      // Create promises for both the network response,
      // and a copy of the response that can be used in the cache.
      const fetchResponseP = fetch(normalizedUrl);
      const fetchResponseCloneP = fetchResponseP.then(r => r.clone());

      // event.waitUntil() ensures that the service worker is kept alive
      // long enough to complete the cache update.
      event.waitUntil(async function() {
        const cache = await caches.open('my-cache-name');
        await cache.put(normalizedUrl, await fetchResponseCloneP);
      }());

      // Prefer the cached response, falling back to the fetch response.
      return caches.match(normalizedUrl) || fetchResponseP;
    }());
  }
});
```

Another approach is to use a tool like [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/), which
hooks into your web app's build process to generate a service worker that
handles caching all of your static resources (not just HTML documents), serving
them cache-first, and keeping them up to date.

### Using an Application Shell

If you have an existing single page application, then the
[application shell architecture](/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)
is straightforward to implement. There's a clear-cut strategy for handling
navigation requests without relying on the network: each navigation request,
regardless of the specific URL, is fulfilled with a cached copy of a generic
"shell" of an HTML document. The shell includes everything needed to bootstrap
the single page application, and client-side routing logic can then render the
content specific to the request's URL.

Written by hand, the corresponding service worker `fetch` handler would look
something like:

```js
// Not shown: install and activate handlers to keep app-shell.html
// cached and up to date.
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  if (event.request.mode === 'navigate') {
    // Always respond to navigations with the cached app-shell.html,
    // regardless of the underlying event.request.url value.
    event.respondWith(caches.match('app-shell.html'));
  }
});
```

[Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/) can also help here, both by ensuring your
`app-shell.html` is cached and kept up to date, as well as providing
[helpers](https://workboxjs.org/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-sw.Router.html#registerNavigationRoute)
for responding to navigation requests with the cached shell.

## ⚠️ Performance gotchas

If you can't respond to navigations using cached data, but you need a service
worker for other functionality—like providing
[offline fallback content](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#generic-fallback),
or [handling push notifications](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/push-notifications/)
—then you're in an awkward situation. If you don't take specific precautions,
you could end up taking a performance hit when you add in your service worker.
But by steering clear of these gotchas, you'll be on solid ground.

### Never use a "passthrough" fetch handler

If you're using a service worker just for push notifications, you might
mistakenly think that the following is either required, or will just be treated
as a no-op:

```js
// Don't do this!
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(fetch(event.request));
});
```

This type of "passthrough" fetch handler is insidious, since everything will
continue to work in your web application, but you'll end up introducing a small
latency hit whenever a network request is made. There's overhead involved in
starting up a service worker if it's not already running, and there's also
overhead in passing the response from the service worker to the client that made
the request.

If your service worker doesn't contain a `fetch` handler at all, some browsers
will make note of that and [not bother starting up the service
worker](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/718) whenever there's a
network request.

### Use navigation preload when appropriate

There are scenarios in which you *need* a `fetch` handler to use a caching
strategy for certain subresources, but your architecture makes it impossible to
respond to navigation requests. Alternatively, you might be okay with
using cached data in your navigation response, but you still want to make a
network request for fresh data to swap in after the page has loaded.

A feature known as
[Navigation Preload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationPreloadManager)
is relevant for both of those use cases. It can mitigate the delays that a
service worker that didn't respond to navigations might otherwise introduce. It
can also be used for "out of band" requests for fresh data that could then be
used by client-side code after the page has loaded. The
"[Speed up Service Worker with Navigation Preloads](/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload)"
article has all the details you'd need to configure your service worker
accordingly.
