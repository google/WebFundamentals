<p class="intro">
  Service workers provide web pages with capabilities that make them more like 
  native apps. Here are a list of characteristics and apps or sites that 
  demonstrate their use.
</p>

### Responsiveness

What if you could build a web page that took voice 
recordings? Google's sample app called [Voice Memos](https://voice-memos.appspot.com/) 
does exactly that. For a web-based memo app a slow network would mean slow 
playback. Voice Memos solves this by caching memos on the device. The code is 
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/voice-memos).

### Offline access

The [Guitar Tuner app](https://guitar-tuner.appspot.com/)  by Paul Lewis
doesn't need a server to run. But how do you keep it on the  device? A service
worker stores the app's resources so that reopening doesn't require
communicating with a server. The code is also [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/guitar-tuner).
