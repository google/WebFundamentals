<p class="intro">   Service workers have been described as &ldquo;programmable
network proxies&rdquo; and &ldquo;background workers&rdquo;. Neither tells the
whole story. A service worker is a script run by a browser in the background
that lets a developer manage network interactions for one or more client
pages. </p>

A service worker is more than that. Because a service worker is separate from
the page that loaded it, it doesn't  need a web page or user interactions. A
service worker terminates when it's not  being used and reactivates again when
it's needed. A single service worker can  support more than one web page.
