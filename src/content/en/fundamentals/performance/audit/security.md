You won't be able to build a PWA without HTTPS.

Serving your site over HTTPS is fundamental for security, and many APIs won't work without it. If you need to justify implementation costs, find out [why HTTPS matters](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https).

HTTPS should be implemented for all pages and assets â€” not just, for example, on login or checkout pages. This is easy to [check with Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/security) Security panel. Keep a record of any problems. In the following example, the site is not secure since one asset is being served over HTTP.

If a site is not secure, users will be warned in the URL bar. Chrome displays a warning like this:
