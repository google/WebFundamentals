You won't be able to build a PWA without HTTPS.

Serving your site over HTTPS is fundamental for security, and many APIs won't work without it. If you need to justify implementation costs, find out [why HTTPS matters](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https).

If a site uses HTTP for any assets, users will be warned in the URL bar. Chrome displays a warning like the following.

HTTPS should be implemented everywhere â€” not just, for example, on login or checkout pages. Any insecure page or asset can be a vector for attack, making your site a liability for your users and your business.

Site security is easy to check with [Chrome DevTools Security panel](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/security). Keep a record of any problems.

The site in the following example is not secure, since some assets are served over HTTP.
