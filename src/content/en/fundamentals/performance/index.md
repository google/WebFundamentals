Improving performance is a process that starts with minimizing, or at least, optimizing the data that users download. Understanding how a browser renders those resources is a prerequisite for improving code efficiency. After improving it, you need a way to test it. 

## Optimizing Content Efficiency

To write performant sites and apps you need to understand how HTML, JavaScript and CSS are handled by the browser, and ensure that the code you write (and third-party code you include) runs as efficiently as possible.

PRPL (push, render, pre-cache and lazy-load) is a pattern for structuring
and serving Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), with an emphasis on the performance
of app delivery and launch.
