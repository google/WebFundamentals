# Web Font Optimization {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/ilyagrigorik.html" %}

Typography is fundamental to good design, branding, readability, and accessibility. Webfonts enable all of the above and more: the text is selectable, searchable, zoomable, and high-DPI friendly, providing consistent and sharp text rendering regardless of the screen size and resolution. Webfonts are critical to good design, UX, and performance.

Webfont optimization is a critical piece of the overall performance strategy. Each font is an additional resource, and some fonts may block rendering of the text, but just because the page is using webfonts doesn't mean that it has to render slower. On the contrary, optimized fonts, combined with a judicious strategy for how they are loaded and applied on the page, can help reduce the total page size and improve page rendering times.


## Anatomy of a webfont

### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }
* Unicode fonts can contain thousands of glyphs.
* There are four font formats: WOFF2, WOFF, EOT, and TTF.
* Some font formats require the use of GZIP compression.


A *webfont* is a collection of glyphs, and each glyph is a vector shape that describes a letter or symbol. As a result, two simple variables determine the size of a particular font file: the complexity of the vector paths of each glyph and the number of glyphs in a particular font. For example, Open Sans, which is one of the most popular webfonts, contains 897 glyphs, which include Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic characters.

<img src="images/glyphs.png"  alt="Font glyph table">

When picking a font, it's important to consider which character sets are supported. If you need to localize your page content to multiple languages, you should use a font that can deliver a consistent look and experience to your users. For example, [Google's Noto font family](https://www.google.com/get/noto/){: .external } aims to support all the world's languages. Note, however, that the total size of Noto, with all languages included, results in a 130MB+ ZIP download.

Clearly, using fonts on the web requires careful engineering to ensure that the typography doesn't impede performance. Thankfully, the web platform provides all the necessary primitives, and the rest of this guide provides a hands-on look at how to get the best of both worlds.

### Webfont formats

Today there are four font container formats in use on the web: [EOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_OpenType), [TTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType), [WOFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format), and [WOFF2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/){: .external }. Unfortunately, despite the wide range of choices, there isn't a single universal format that works across all old and new browsers: EOT is [IE only](http://caniuse.com/#feat=eot), TTF has [partial IE support](http://caniuse.com/#search=ttf), WOFF enjoys the widest support but is [not available in some older browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=woff), and WOFF 2.0 support is a [work in progress for many browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2).

So, where does that leave us? There isn't a single format that works in all browsers, which means that we need to deliver multiple formats to provide a consistent experience:

* Serve WOFF 2.0 variant to browsers that support it.
* Serve WOFF variant to the majority of browsers.
* Serve TTF variant to old Android (below 4.4) browsers.
* Serve EOT variant to old IE (below IE9) browsers.

Note: There's technically another container format, the <a href='http://caniuse.com/svg-fonts'>SVG font container</a>, but IE and Firefox never supported it, and it is now deprecated in Chrome. As such, it's of limited use and it's intentionally omitted it in this guide.

### Reducing font size with compression

A font is a collection of glyphs, each of which is a set of paths describing the letter form. The individual glyphs are different, but they contain a lot of similar information that can be compressed with GZIP or a compatible compressor: 

* EOT and TTF formats are not compressed by default. Ensure that your servers are configured to apply [GZIP compression](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer#text-compression-with-gzip) when delivering these formats.
* WOFF has built-in compression. Ensure that your WOFF compressor is using optimal compression settings. 
* WOFF2 uses custom preprocessing and compression algorithms to deliver ~30% file-size reduction over other formats. For more information, see [the WOFF 2.0 evaluation report](http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF20ER/){: .external }.

Finally, it's worth noting that some font formats contain additional metadata, such as [font hinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting) and [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning) information that may not be necessary on some platforms, which allows for further file-size optimization. Consult your font compressor for available optimization options, and if you take this route, ensure that you have the appropriate infrastructure to test and deliver these optimized fonts to each browser. For example, Google Fonts maintains 30+ optimized variants for each font and automatically detects and delivers the optimal variant for each platform and browser.

Note: Consider using <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopfli'>Zopfli compression</a> for the EOT, TTF, and WOFF formats. Zopfli is a zlib compatible compressor that delivers ~5% file-size reduction over gzip.

## Defining font family with @font-face

### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }
* Use the <code>format()</code> hint to specify multiple font formats.
* Subset large Unicode fonts to improve performance. Use Unicode-range subsetting and provide a manual subsetting fallback for older browsers.
* Reduce the number of stylistic font variants to improve the page- and text-rendering performance.


The @font-face CSS at-rule allows you to define the location of a particular font resource, its style characteristics, and the Unicode codepoints for which it should be used. A combination of such @font-face declarations can be used to construct a "font family," which the browser will use to evaluate which font resources need to be downloaded and applied to the current page.

### Format selection

Each @font-face declaration provides the name of the font family, which acts as a logical group of multiple declarations, [font properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-prop-desc) such as style, weight, and stretch, and the [src descriptor](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#src-desc), which specifies a prioritized list of locations for the font resource.


    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Awesome Font';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 400;
      src: local('Awesome Font'),
           url('/fonts/awesome.woff2') format('woff2'), 
           url('/fonts/awesome.woff') format('woff'),
           url('/fonts/awesome.ttf') format('truetype'),
           url('/fonts/awesome.eot') format('embedded-opentype');
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Awesome Font';
      font-style: italic;
      font-weight: 400;
      src: local('Awesome Font Italic'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-i.woff2') format('woff2'), 
           url('/fonts/awesome-i.woff') format('woff'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-i.ttf') format('truetype'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-i.eot') format('embedded-opentype');
    }


First, note that the above examples define a single _Awesome Font_ family with two styles (normal and _italic_), each of which points to a different set of font resources. In turn, each `src` descriptor contains a prioritized, 
comma-separated list of resource variants: 

* The `local()` directive allows you to reference, load, and use locally installed fonts.
* The `url()` directive allows you to load external fonts, and are allowed to contain an optional `format()` hint indicating the format of the font referenced by the provided URL.


Note: Unless you're referencing one of the default system fonts, in practice it is rare for the user to have it locally installed, especially on mobile devices, where it is effectively impossible to 'install' additional fonts. As a result, you should always provide a list of external font locations.

When the browser determines that the font is needed, it iterates through the provided resource list in the specified order and tries to load the appropriate resource. For example, following the example above:

1. The browser performs page layout and determines which font variants are required to render the specified text on the page.
1. For each required font, the browser checks if the font is available locally.
1. If the font is not available locally, the browser iterates over external definitions:
    * If a format hint is present, the browser checks if it supports the hint before initiating the download. If the browser doesn't support the hint, the browser advances to the next one.
    * If no format hint is present, the browser downloads the resource.

The combination of local and external directives with appropriate format hints allows you to specify all of the available font formats and let the browser handle the rest. The browser determines which resources are required and selects the optimal format.

Note: The order in which the font variants are specified matters. The browser picks the first format it supports. Therefore, if you want the newer browsers to use WOFF2, then you should place the WOFF2 declaration above WOFF, and so on.

### Unicode-range subsetting

In addition to font properties such as style, weight, and stretch, the 
@font-face rule allows us to define a set of Unicode codepoints supported by 
each resource. This enables us to split a large Unicode font into smaller 
subsets (for example, Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek subsets) and only download the glyphs required to render the text on a particular page.

The [unicode-range descriptor](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#descdef-unicode-range) allows you to specify a comma-delimited list of range values, each of which can be in one of three different forms:

* Single codepoint (for example, U+416)
* Interval range (for example, U+400-4ff): indicates the start and end codepoints of a range
* Wildcard range (for example, U+4??): '?' characters indicate any hexadecimal digit

For example, you can split your _Awesome Font_ family into Latin and Japanese 
subsets, each of which the browser downloads on an as-needed basis: 


    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Awesome Font';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 400;
      src: local('Awesome Font'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.woff2') format('woff2'), 
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.woff') format('woff'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.ttf') format('truetype'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.eot') format('embedded-opentype');
      unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */
    }
    
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Awesome Font';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 400;
      src: local('Awesome Font'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-jp.woff2') format('woff2'), 
           url('/fonts/awesome-jp.woff') format('woff'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-jp.ttf') format('truetype'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-jp.eot') format('embedded-opentype');
      unicode-range: U+3000-9FFF, U+ff??; /* Japanese glyphs */
    }
    

Note: Unicode-range subsetting is particularly important for Asian languages, where the number of glyphs is much larger than in Western languages and a typical "full" font is often measured in megabytes instead of tens of kilobytes.

The use of Unicode range subsets and separate files for each stylistic variant of the font allows you to define a composite font family that is both faster and more efficient to download. Visitors only download the variants and subsets they need, and they aren't forced to download subsets that they may never see or use on the page. 

That said, there's one small issue with unicode-range: [not all browser 
support it](http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-unicode-range) yet. Some browsers 
simply ignore the unicode-range hint and download all variants, while 
others may not process the @font-face declaration at all. To address this, you need to fall back to "manual subsetting" for older browsers.

Because old browsers are not smart enough to select only the necessary subsets and cannot construct a composite font, you have to fall back to providing a single font resource that contains all the necessary subsets and hide the rest from the browser. For example, if the page is only using Latin characters, then you can strip other glyphs and serve that particular subset as a standalone resource. 

1. **How do you determine which subsets are needed?** 
    * If the browser supports unicode-range subsetting, then it will automatically select the right subset. The page just needs to provide the subset files and specify appropriate unicode-ranges in the @font-face rules.
    * If the browser doesn't support unicode-range subsetting, then the page needs to hide all unnecessary subsets; that is, the developer must specify the required subsets.
1. **How do you generate font subsets?**
    - Use the open-source [pyftsubset tool](https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/){: .external } to subset and optimize your fonts.
    - Some font services allow manual subsetting via custom query parameters, which you can use to manually specify the required subset for your page. Consult the documentation from your font provider.


### Font selection and synthesis

Each font family is composed of multiple stylistic variants (regular, bold, italic) and multiple weights for each style, each of which, in turn, may contain very different glyph shapes&mdash;for example, different spacing, sizing, or a different shape altogether. 

<img src="images/font-weights.png"  alt="Font weights">

For example, the above diagram illustrates a font family that offers three 
different bold weights: 400 (regular), 700 (bold), and 900 (extra bold). All 
other in-between variants (indicated in gray) are automatically mapped to the 
closest variant by the browser. 



> When a weight is specified for which no face exists, a face with a nearby weight is used. In general, bold weights map to faces with heavier weights and light weights map to faces with lighter weights.
> > <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-matching-algorithm">CSS3 font matching algorithm</a>



Similar logic applies to _italic_ variants. The font designer controls which 
variants they will produce, and you control which variants you'll use on the 
page. Because each variant is a separate download, it's a good idea to keep the 
number of variants small. For example, you can define two bold variants for the 
_Awesome Font_ family: 


    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Awesome Font';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 400;
      src: local('Awesome Font'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.woff2') format('woff2'), 
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.woff') format('woff'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.ttf') format('truetype'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l.eot') format('embedded-opentype');
      unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */
    }
    
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Awesome Font';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 700;
      src: local('Awesome Font'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l-700.woff2') format('woff2'), 
           url('/fonts/awesome-l-700.woff') format('woff'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l-700.ttf') format('truetype'),
           url('/fonts/awesome-l-700.eot') format('embedded-opentype');
      unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */
    }
    

The above example declares the _Awesome Font_ family that is composed of two resources that cover the same set of Latin glyphs (U+000-5FF) but offer two different "weights": normal (400) and bold (700). However, what happens if one of your CSS rules specifies a different font weight, or sets the font-style 
property to italic?

* If an exact font match isn't available, the browser substitutes the closest match.
* If no stylistic match is found (for example, no italic variants were declared in the example above), then the browser synthesizes its own font variant. 

<img src="images/font-synthesis.png"  alt="Font synthesis">


> Authors should also be aware that synthesized approaches may not be suitable for scripts like Cyrillic, where italic forms are very different in shape. It is always better to use an actual italic font rather than rely on a synthetic version.
> > <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#propdef-font-style">CSS3 font-style</a>


The example above illustrates the difference between the actual vs. synthesized font results for Open-Sans. All synthesized variants are generated from a single 400-weight font. As you can see, there's a noticeable difference in the results. The details of how to generate the bold and oblique variants are not specified. Therefore, the results vary from browser to browser, and are highly dependent on the font.

Note: For best consistency and visual results, don't rely on font synthesis. Instead, minimize the number of used font variants and specify their locations, such that the browser can download them when they are used on the page. That said, in some cases a synthesized variant <a href='https://www.igvita.com/2014/09/16/optimizing-webfont-selection-and-synthesis/'>may be a viable option</a>, but be cautious in using synthesized variants.

## Optimizing loading and rendering

### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }
* Font requests are delayed until the render tree is constructed, which can result in delayed text rendering.
* The Font Loading API allows you to implement custom font loading and rendering strategies that override default lazyload font loading.
* Font inlining allows you to override default lazyload font loading in older browsers.

A "full" webfont that includes all stylistic variants, which you may not need, plus all the glyphs, which may go unused, can easily result in a multi-megabyte download. To address this, the @font-face CSS rule is specifically designed to allow you to split the font family into a collection of resources: unicode subsets, distinct style variants, and so on. 

Given these declarations, the browser figures out the required subsets and variants and downloads the minimal set required to render the text, which is very convenient. However, if you're not careful, it can also create a performance bottleneck in the critical rendering path and delay text rendering. 

### Webfonts and the critical rendering path

Lazy loading of fonts carries an important hidden implication that may delay text rendering: the browser must [construct the render tree](/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-tree-construction), which is dependent on the DOM and CSSOM trees, before it knows which font resources it needs in order to render the text. As a result, font requests are delayed well after other critical resources, and the browser may be blocked from rendering text until the resource is fetched.

<img src="images/font-crp.png"  alt="Font critical rendering path">

1. The browser requests the HTML document.
1. The browser begins parsing the HTML response and constructing the DOM.
1. The browser discovers CSS, JS, and other resources and dispatches requests.
1. The browser constructs the CSSOM after all of the CSS content is received and combines it with the DOM tree to construct the render tree.
    * Font requests are dispatched after the render tree indicates which font variants are needed to render the specified text on the page.
1. The browser performs layout and paints content to the screen.
    * If the font is not yet available, the browser may not render any text pixels.
    * After the font is available, the browser paints the text pixels.

The "race" between the first paint of page content, which can be done shortly 
after the render tree is built, and the request for the font resource is what 
creates the "blank text problem" where the browser might render page layout but 
omits any text. The actual behavior differs between various browsers:

* Safari delays text rendering until the font download is complete.
* Chrome and Firefox delay font rendering for up to 3 seconds, after which they use a fallback font. After the font download has finished, they re-render the text with the downloaded font.
* IE immediately renders with the fallback font if the request font is not yet available, and re-renders the text after the font download is complete.

There are good arguments for and against the different rendering strategies. Some people find re-rendering jarring, while others prefer to see immediate results and don't mind the page reflow after the font download has finished - we won't get into this argument here. The important point is that lazyloading 
reduces the number of bytes, but also has the potential to delay text rendering. The next section describes how you can optimize this behavior.

### Optimizing font rendering with the Font Loading API

The [Font Loading API](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-font-loading/) provides a scripting interface to define and manipulate CSS font faces, track their download progress, and override their default lazyload behavior. For example, if you're sure that a particular font variant is required, you can define it and tell the browser to initiate an immediate fetch of the font resource:


    var font = new FontFace("Awesome Font", "url(/fonts/awesome.woff2)", {
      style: 'normal', unicodeRange: 'U+000-5FF', weight: '400'
    });
    
    // don't wait for the render tree, initiate an immediate fetch!
    font.load().then(function() {
      // apply the font (which may re-render text and cause a page reflow)
      // after the font has finished downloading
      document.fonts.add(font);
      document.body.style.fontFamily = "Awesome Font, serif";
    
      // OR... by default the content is hidden, 
      // and it's rendered after the font is available
      var content = document.getElementById("content");
      content.style.visibility = "visible";
    
      // OR... apply your own render strategy here... 
    });
    

Further, because you can check the font status (via the [check()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-font-loading/#font-face-set-check)) method and track its download progress, you can also define a custom strategy for rendering text on your pages: 

* You can hold all text rendering until the font is available.
* You can implement a custom timeout for each font.
* You can use the fallback font to unblock rendering and inject a new style that uses the desired font after the font is available.

Best of all, you can also mix and match the above strategies for different content on the page. For example, you can delay text rendering on some sections until the font is available, use a fallback font, and then re-render after the font download has finished, specify different timeouts, and so on. 

Note: The Font Loading API is still <a href='http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-loading'>under development in some browsers</a>. Consider using the <a href='https://github.com/bramstein/fontloader'>FontLoader polyfill</a> or the <a href='https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader'>webfontloader library</a> to deliver similar functionality, albeit with the overhead of an additional JavaScript dependency.

### Optimizing font rendering with inlining

A simple alternative strategy to using the Font Loading API to eliminate the "blank text problem" is to inline the font contents into a CSS style sheet:

* The browser automatically downloads, with high priority, CSS style sheets with matching media queries because constructing the CSSOM requires them.
* Inlining the font data into the CSS style sheet forces the browser to download the font with high priority and without waiting for the render tree. That is, this acts as a manual override to the default lazyload behavior.

The inlining strategy is not as flexible and does not allow you to define custom timeouts or rendering strategies for different content, but it is a simple and robust solution that works across all browsers. For best results, separate inlined fonts into a standalone style sheet and serve them with a long max-age. This way, when you update your CSS, you are not forcing your visitors to re-download the fonts. 

Note: Use inlining selectively. Remember that the reason @font-face uses lazyload behavior is to avoid downloading unnecessary font variants and subsets. Also, increasing the size of your CSS via aggressive inlining will negatively impact your <a href='/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/'>critical rendering path</a>. The browser must download all CSS before it can construct the CSSOM, build the render tree, and render page contents to the screen.

### Optimizing font reuse with HTTP caching

Font resources are, typically, static resources that don't see frequent updates. As a result, they are ideally suited for a long max-age expiry - ensure that you specify both a [conditional ETag header](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#validating-cached-responses-with-etags), and an [optimal Cache-Control policy](/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#cache-control) for all font resources.   
    
You don't need to store fonts in localStorage or via other mechanisms; each 
of those has its own set of performance issues. The browser's HTTP cache, in 
combination with the Font Loading API or the webfontloader library, provides the 
best and most robust mechanism to deliver font resources to the browser.


## Optimization checklist

Contrary to popular belief, the use of webfonts doesn't need to delay page rendering or have a negative impact on other performance metrics. The well-optimized use of fonts can deliver a much better overall user experience: great branding, improved readability, usability, and searchability, all while delivering a scalable multi-resolution solution that adapts well to all screen formats and resolutions. Don't be afraid to use webfonts. 

That said, a naive implementation may incur large downloads and unnecessary delays. You need to help the browser by optimizing the font assets themselves and how they are fetched and used on your pages. 

* **Audit and monitor your font use:** don't use too many fonts on your pages, and, for each font, minimize the number of used variants. This helps produce a more consistent and a faster experience for your users.
* **Subset your font resources:** many fonts can be subset, or split into multiple unicode-ranges to deliver just the glyphs that a particular page requires. This reduces the file size and improves the download speed of the resource. However, when defining the subsets, be careful to optimize for font re-use. For example, don't download a different but overlapping set of characters on each page. A good practice is to subset based on script: for example, Latin, Cyrillic, and so on.
* **Deliver optimized font formats to each browser:** provide each font in WOFF2, WOFF, EOT, and TTF formats. Make sure to apply GZIP compression to the EOT and TTF formats, because they are not compressed by default.
* **Specify revalidation and optimal caching policies:** fonts are static resources that are infrequently updated. Make sure that your servers provide a long-lived max-age timestamp and a revalidation token to allow for efficient font reuse between different pages.
* **Use the Font Loading API to optimize the Critical Rendering Path:** default lazyloading behavior may result in delayed text rendering. The Font Loading API allows you to override this behavior for particular fonts, and to specify custom rendering and timeout strategies for different content on the page. For older browsers that don't support the API, you can use the Web Font Loader JavaScript library or use the CSS inlining strategy.
