{% include "web/_shared/contributors/iamakulov.html" %}

The next thing (after [optimizing the app size](./decrease-frontend-size)) that
improves the app loading time is caching. Use it to keep parts of the app on the
client and avoid re-downloading them every time.

## Use bundle versioning and cache headers

The common approach of doing caching is to:

<ol>
<li>
tell the browser to cache a file for a very long time (e.g., a year):

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Server header
Cache-Control: max-age=31536000
</pre>

Note: If you aren’t familiar what `Cache-Control` does, see Jake Archibald’s
excellent post <a
href="https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/">on caching best
practices</a>.

</li>

<li>
and rename the file when it’s changed to force the re-download:

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!-- Before the change -->
&lt;script src="./index-v15.js">&lt;/script>

&lt;!-- After the change -->
&lt;script src="./index-v16.js">&lt;/script>
</pre>

</li>
</ol>

This approach tells the browser to download the JS file, cache it and use the
cached copy. The browser will only hit the network only if the file name changes
(or if a year passes).

With webpack, you do the same, but instead of a version number, you specify the
file hash. To include the hash into the file name, use
[`[chunkhash]`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-filename):

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.<strong>[chunkhash]</strong>.js',
        // → bundle.8e0d62a03.js
  },
};
</pre>

Note: Webpack could generate a different hash even if the bundle stays the same
– e.g. if you rename a file or compile the bundle under a different OS. This is
a bug, and there’s no clear solution yet. [See the discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1479)

If you need the
file name to send it to the client, use either the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` or the
`WebpackManifestPlugin`.

The [`HtmlWebpackPlugin`](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) is a
simple, but less flexible approach. During compilation, this plugin generates an
HTML file which includes all compiled resources. If your server logic isn’t
complex, then it should be enough for you:

    <!-- index.html -->
    <!doctype html>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="bundle.8e0d62a03.js"></script>

The
[`WebpackManifestPlugin`](https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin)
is a more flexible approach which is useful if you have a complex server part.
During the build, it generates a JSON file with a mapping between file names
without hash and file names with hash. Use this JSON on the server to find out
which file to work with:

    // manifest.json
    {
      "bundle.js": "bundle.8e0d62a03.js"
    }

  practices](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/)

## Extract dependencies and runtime into a separate file

### Dependencies

App dependencies tend to change less often than the actual app code. If you move
them into a separate file, the browser will be able to cache them separately –
and won’t re-download them each time the app code changes.

Key Term: In webpack terminology, separate files with the app code are called
_chunks_. We’ll use this name later.

To extract dependencies into a separate chunk, perform three steps:

<ol>
<li>
Replace the output filename with <code>[name].[chunkname].js</code>:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: {
    // Before
    filename: 'bundle.[chunkhash].js',
    // After
    filename: '[name].[chunkhash].js',
  },
};
</pre>

When webpack builds the app, it replaces <a
href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-filename"><code>[name]</code></a>
with a name of a chunk. If we don’t add the <code>[name]</code> part, we’ll have
to differentiate between chunks by their hash – which is pretty hard!

</li>

<li>

Convert the <code>entry</code> field into an object:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Before
  entry: './index.js',
  // After
  entry: {
    main: './index.js',
  },
};
</pre>

<p>In this snippet, “main” is a name of a chunk. This name will be substituted in
place of <code>[name]</code> from step 1.</p>

<p>By now, if you build the app, this chunk will include the whole app code – just
like we haven’t done these steps. But this will change in a sec.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p><b>In webpack 4,</b> add the <code>optimization.splitChunks.chunks: 'all'</code> option
into your webpack config:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js (for webpack 4)
module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
    }
  },
};
</pre>

<p>This option enables smart code splitting. With it, webpack would extract the vendor code if
it gets larger than 30 kB (before minification and gzip). It would also extract the common code –
this is useful if your build produces several bundles (e.g.
<a href="#split-the-code-into-routes-and-pages">if you split your app into routes</a>).</p>

<p><b>In webpack 3,</b> add the <a
href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/"><code>CommonsChunkPlugin</code></a>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js (for webpack 3)
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
      // A name of the chunk that will include the dependencies.
      // This name is substituted in place of [name] from step 1
      name: 'vendor',

      // A function that determines which modules to include into this chunk
      minChunks: module => module.context &&
        module.context.includes('node_modules'),
    }),
  ],
};
</pre>

<p>This plugin takes all modules which paths include <code>node_modules</code> and
moves them into a separate file called <code>vendor.[chunkhash].js</code>.</p>

</li>
</ol>

After these changes, each build will generate two files instead of one: `main.[chunkhash].js` and
`vendor.[chunkhash].js` (`vendors~main.[chunkhash].js` for webpack 4). In case of webpack 4,
the vendor bundle might not be generated if dependencies are small – and that’s fine:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ webpack
Hash: ac01483e8fec1fa70676
Version: webpack 3.8.1
Time: 3816ms
                           Asset   Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
  ./main.00bab6fd3100008a42b0.js  82 kB       0  [emitted]  main
./vendor.d9e134771799ecdf9483.js  47 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
</pre>

The browser would cache these files separately – and redownload only code that changes.

### Webpack runtime code

Unfortunately, extracting just the vendor code is not enough. If you try to
change something in the app code:

    // index.js
    …
    …

    // E.g. add this:
    console.log('Wat');

you’ll notice that the `vendor` hash also changes:

<pre class="prettyprint">
                           Asset   Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
./vendor.d9e134771799ecdf9483.js  47 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
</pre>

↓

<pre class="prettyprint">
                            Asset   Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
./vendor.e6ea4504d61a1cc1c60b.js  47 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
</pre>

This happens because the webpack bundle, apart from the code of modules, has [_a
runtime_](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/manifest/) – a small piece of code
that manages the module execution. When you split the code into multiple files,
this piece of code starts including a mapping between chunk ids and
corresponding files:

    // vendor.e6ea4504d61a1cc1c60b.js
    script.src = __webpack_require__.p + chunkId + "." + {
      "0": "2f2269c7f0a55a5c1871"
    }[chunkId] + ".js";

Webpack includes this runtime into the last generated chunk, which is `vendor`
in our case. And every time any chunk changes, this piece of code changes too,
causing the whole <code>vendor</code> chunk to change.

To solve this, let’s move the runtime into a separate file. **In webpack 4,** this is
achieved by enabling the `optimization.runtimeChunk` option:

    // webpack.config.js (for webpack 4)
    module.exports = {
      optimization: {
        runtimeChunk: true,
      },
    };

**In webpack 3,** do this by creating an extra empty chunk with the `CommonsChunkPlugin`:

    // webpack.config.js (for webpack 3)
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
          name: 'vendor',

          minChunks: module => module.context &&
            module.context.includes('node_modules'),
        }),

        // This plugin must come after the vendor one (because webpack
        // includes runtime into the last chunk)
        new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
          name: 'runtime',

          // minChunks: Infinity means that no app modules
          // will be included into this chunk
          minChunks: Infinity,
        }),
      ],
    };

After these changes, each build will be generating three files:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ webpack
Hash: ac01483e8fec1fa70676
Version: webpack 3.8.1
Time: 3816ms
                            Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
   ./main.00bab6fd3100008a42b0.js    82 kB       0  [emitted]  main
 ./vendor.26886caf15818fa82dfa.js    46 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
./runtime.79f17c27b335abc7aaf4.js  1.45 kB       3  [emitted]  runtime
</pre>

Include them into `index.html` in the reverse order – and you’re done:

    <!-- index.html -->
    <script src="./runtime.79f17c27b335abc7aaf4.js"></script>
    <script src="./vendor.26886caf15818fa82dfa.js"></script>
    <script src="./main.00bab6fd3100008a42b0.js"></script>

## Inline webpack runtime to save an extra HTTP request

To make things even better, try inlining the webpack runtime into the HTML
response. I.e., instead of this:

    <!-- index.html -->
    <script src="./runtime.79f17c27b335abc7aaf4.js"></script>

do this:

    <!-- index.html -->
    <script>
    !function(e){function n(r){if(t[r])return t[r].exports;…}} ([]);
    </script>

The runtime is small, and inlining it will help you save an HTTP request (pretty
important with HTTP/1; less important with HTTP/2 but might still play an
effect).

Here’s how to do it.

### If you generate HTML with the HtmlWebpackPlugin

If you use the
[HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) to generate
an HTML file, the
[InlineSourcePlugin](https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin)
is all you need:

    // webpack.config.js
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
    const InlineSourcePlugin = require('html-webpack-inline-source-plugin');
    
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
          // Inline all files which names start with “runtime~” and end with “.js”.
          // That’s the default naming of runtime chunks
          inlineSource: 'runtime~.+\\.js',
        }),
        // This plugin enables the “inlineSource” option
        new InlineSourcePlugin(),
      ],
    };

### If you generate HTML using a custom server logic

**With webpack 4:**

<ol>
<li>

Add the
<a href="https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin"><code>WebpackManifestPlugin</code></a>
to know the generated name of the runtime chunk:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js (for webpack 4)
const ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ManifestPlugin(),
  ],
};
</pre>

A build with this plugin would create a file that looks like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// manifest.json
{
  "runtime~main.js": "runtime~main.8e0d62a03.js"
}
</pre>

</li>

<li>

Inline the content of the runtime chunk in a convenient way. E.g. with
Node.js and Express:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// server.js
const fs = require('fs');
const manifest = require('./manifest.json');

const runtimeContent = fs.readFileSync(manifest['runtime~main.js'], 'utf-8');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    …
    &lt;script>${runtimeContent}&lt;/script>
    …
  `);
});
</pre>

</li>
</ol>

**Or with webpack 3:**

<ol>
<li>

Make the runtime name static by specifying <code>filename</code>:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js (for webpack 3)
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
      name: 'runtime',
      minChunks: Infinity,
      filename: 'runtime.js',
        // → Now the runtime file will be called
        // “runtime.js”, not “runtime.79f17c27b335abc7aaf4.js”
    }),
  ],
};
</pre>

</li>

<li>

Inline the <code>runtime.js</code> content in a convenient way. E.g. with
Node.js and Express:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// server.js
const fs = require('fs');
const runtimeContent = fs.readFileSync('./runtime.js', 'utf-8');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    …
    &lt;script>${runtimeContent}&lt;/script>
    …
  `);
});
</pre>

</li>
</ol>

## Lazy-load code that you don’t need right now {: #lazy-loading }

Sometimes, a page has more and less important parts:

* If you load a video page on YouTube, you care more about the video than about
  comments. Here, the video is more important than comments.

* If you open an article on a news site, you care more about the text of the
  article than about ads. Here, the text is more important than ads.

In such cases, improve the initial loading performance by downloading only the
most important stuff first, and lazy-loading the remaining parts later. Use [the
`import()` function](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#import-) and
[code-splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) for this:

    // videoPlayer.js
    export function renderVideoPlayer() { … }

    // comments.js
    export function renderComments() { … }

    // index.js
    import {renderVideoPlayer} from './videoPlayer';
    renderVideoPlayer();

    // …Custom event listener
    onShowCommentsClick(() => {
      import('./comments').then((comments) => {
        comments.renderComments();
      });
    });

`import()` specifies that you want to load a specific module dynamically. When
webpack sees `import('./module.js')`, it moves this module into a separate
chunk:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ webpack
Hash: 39b2a53cb4e73f0dc5b2
Version: webpack 3.8.1
Time: 4273ms
                            Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
      ./0.8ecaf182f5c85b7a8199.js  22.5 kB       0  [emitted]
   ./main.f7e53d8e13e9a2745d6d.js    60 kB       1  [emitted]  main
 ./vendor.4f14b6326a80f4752a98.js    46 kB       2  [emitted]  vendor
./runtime.79f17c27b335abc7aaf4.js  1.45 kB       3  [emitted]  runtime
</pre>

and downloads it only when execution reaches the `import()` function.

This will make the `main` bundle smaller, improving the initial loading time.
Even more, it will improve caching – if you change the code in the main chunk,
comments chunk won’t get affected.

Note: If you compile this code with Babel, you’ll have a syntax error because
Babel doesn’t understand `import()` out of the box. To avoid the error, add the
[`syntax-dynamic-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import)
plugin.

## Split the code into routes and pages {: #split-the-code-into-routes-and-pages }

If your app has multiple routes or pages, but there’s only a single JS file with
the code (a single `main` chunk), it’s likely that you’re serving extra bytes on
each request. For example, when a user visits a home page of your site:

<figure>
  <img src="./site-home-page.png" alt="A WebFundamentals home page">
</figure>

they don’t need to load the code for rendering an article that’s on a different
page – but they will load it. Moreover, if the user always visits only the home
page, and you make a change in the article code, webpack will invalidate the
whole bundle – and the user will have to re-download the whole app.

If we split the app into pages (or routes, if it’s a single-page app), the user
will download only the relevant code. Plus, the browser will cache the app code
better: if you change the home page code, webpack will invalidate only the
corresponding chunk.

### For single-page apps

To split single-page apps by routes, use `import()` (see the [“Lazy-load code
that you don’t need right now”](#lazy-loading) section). If you use a framework,
it might have an existing solution for this:

* [“Code
  Splitting”](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/code-splitting)
  in `react-router`'s docs (for React)

* [“Lazy Loading
  Routes”](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/lazy-loading.html) in
  `vue-router`'s docs (for Vue.js)

### For traditional multi-page apps

To split traditional apps by pages, use webpack’s [entry
points](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/). If your app has three
kinds of pages: the home page, the article page and the user account page, – it
should have three entries:

    // webpack.config.js
    module.exports = {
      entry: {
        home: './src/Home/index.js',
        article: './src/Article/index.js',
        profile: './src/Profile/index.js'
      },
    };

For each entry file, webpack will build a separate dependency tree and generate
a bundle that includes only modules that are used by that entry:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ webpack
Hash: 318d7b8490a7382bf23b
Version: webpack 3.8.1
Time: 4273ms
                            Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
      ./0.8ecaf182f5c85b7a8199.js  22.5 kB       0  [emitted]
   ./home.91b9ed27366fe7e33d6a.js    18 kB       1  [emitted]  home
./article.87a128755b16ac3294fd.js    32 kB       2  [emitted]  article
./profile.de945dc02685f6166781.js    24 kB       3  [emitted]  profile
 ./vendor.4f14b6326a80f4752a98.js    46 kB       4  [emitted]  vendor
./runtime.318d7b8490a7382bf23b.js  1.45 kB       5  [emitted]  runtime
</pre>

So, if only the article page uses Lodash, the `home` and the `profile` bundles
won’t include it – and the user won’t have to download this library when
visiting the home page.

Separate dependency trees have their drawbacks though. If two entry points use
Lodash, and you haven’t moved your dependencies into a vendor bundle, both entry
points will include a copy of Lodash. To solve this, **in webpack 4,** add the
`optimization.splitChunks.chunks: 'all'` option into your webpack config:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// webpack.config.js (for webpack 4)
module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
    }
  },
};
</pre>

This option enables smart code splitting. With this option, webpack would automatically
look for common code and extract it into separate files.

Or, **in webpack 3,** use the [`CommonsChunkPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/)
– it will move common dependencies into a new specified file:

    // webpack.config.js (for webpack 3)
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
          // A name of the chunk that will include the common dependencies
          name: 'common',

          // The plugin will move a module into a common file
          // only if it’s included into `minChunks` chunks
          // (Note that the plugin analyzes all chunks, not only entries)
          minChunks: 2,    // 2 is the default value
        }),
      ],
    };

Feel free to play with the `minChunks` value to find the best one. Generally,
you want to keep it small, but increase if the number of chunks grows. For
example, for 3 chunks, `minChunks` might be 2, but for 30 chunks, it might be 8
– because if you keep it at 2, too many modules will get into the common file,
inflating it too much.

## Make module ids more stable

When building the code, webpack assigns each module an ID. Later, these IDs are
used in `require()`s inside the bundle. You usually see IDs in the build output
right before the module paths:

By default, IDs are calculated using a counter (i.e. the first module has ID 0,
the second one has ID 1, and so on). The problem with this is that when you add
a new module, it might appear in the middle of the module list, changing all the
next modules’ IDs:

<pre class="prettyprint">

   [2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 488 bytes {2} [built]
   [3] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 495 bytes {2} [built]
</pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ We’ve added a new
module...

<pre class="prettyprint">
   [4] ./webPlayer.js 24 kB {1} [built]
</pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ And look what it has
done! `comments.js` now has ID 5 instead of 4

<pre class="prettyprint">
   [5] ./comments.js 58 kB {0} [built]
</pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ `ads.js` now has ID 6
instead of 5

<pre class="prettyprint">
   [6] ./ads.js 74 kB {1} [built]
       + 1 hidden module
</pre>

This invalidates all chunks that include or depend on modules with changed IDs –
even if their actual code hasn’t changed. In our case, the `0` chunk (the chunk
with `comments.js`) and the `main` chunk (the chunk with the other app code) get
invalidated – whereas only the `main` one should’ve been.

To solve this, change how module IDs are calculated using the
[`HashedModuleIdsPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/hashed-module-ids-plugin/).
It replaces counter-based IDs with hashes of module paths:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ webpack

Version: webpack 3.8.1
Time: 2150ms

      ./0.6168aaac8461862eab7a.js  22.5 kB       0  [emitted]
   ./main.a2e49a279552980e3b91.js    60 kB       1  [emitted]  main
 ./vendor.ff9f7ea865884e6a84c8.js    46 kB       2  [emitted]  vendor
./runtime.25f5d0204e4f77fa57a1.js  1.45 kB       3  [emitted]  runtime
</pre>

[3IRH] ./index.js 29 kB {1} [built]
[DuR2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 488 bytes {2} [built]

With this approach, the ID of a module only changes if you rename or move that
module. New modules won’t affect other modules’ IDs.

To enable the plugin, add it to the `plugins` section of the config:

    // webpack.config.js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        new webpack.HashedModuleIdsPlugin(),
      ],
    };

## Summing up

* Cache the bundle and differentiate between versions by changing the bundle name
* Split the bundle into app code, vendor code and runtime
* Inline the runtime to save an HTTP request
* Lazy-load non-critical code with <code>import</code>
* Split code by routes/pages to avoid loading unnecessary stuff
