"HowTo: Components" are a collection of web components that implement common UI
patterns. The purpose of these implementations is to be an educational resource.
You can read through the densely commented implementation of different
components and hopefully learn from them. Note that they are explicitly **NOT**
a UI library and should **NOT** be used in production.

## Goals

Our aim is to demonstrate best practices for writing robust components that are
accessible, performant, maintainable, and easy to style. Each component is
completely self-contained so it can serve as a reference implementation.

### Accessibility

The components closely follow the [WAI ARIA Authoring
Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/), which is a guide to
explain and show ARIA, the [Accessible Rich Internet Application
standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/). If you are unfamiliar with ARIA,
[check out our introduction on
WebFundamentals](/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/).
Each component links to the relevant section of the Authoring Practices. While
not strictly necessary, we do recommend reading the section of the Authoring
Practices before diving into the code.

### Performance

In web development the term "performance" can be applied to a multitude of
things. In the context of `<howto>`, performance mostly refers to animations
consistently running at 60fps, even on mobile devices.

### Visual Flexibility

As much as possible, components are not styled, except for layout or to indicate
a selected or active state. This is to keep the implementation visually flexible
and focused. By not spending time on decoration, we limit the code to only what
is absolutely necessary to make the component function. If any style is required
for the component to function, the style will be marked with a comment
explaining why that is.

### Maintainable code

As HowTo: Components is aimed to be read and function as a reference
implementation, we spent extra time on writing readable and easily
comprehensible code that is densely commented.

## Non-Goals

### Be a library / framework / toolkit

`<howto>` components are not published on npm, bower or any other platform
because they are not meant to be used in production. For the sake of terse,
readable code, we are using modern JavaScript APIs and are supporting modern
browsers which implement the Web Components standards. The idea is that you, the
reader, are able adapt the code to fit your own needs after reading these
implementations.

### Be backwards compatible

The code should not be relied on directly. We might, and very likely *will*,
drastically change the implementation and API of any element if a better
implementation is discovered. This is a living resource where we can share,
explore, and discuss best practices for building web UIs.

### Be complete

We currently don't (and probably won't) implement **all* *components that can be
found in the WAI ARIA Authoring Practices. However, re-using the principles used
in other `<howto>` components should enable readers to implement any components
that are missing.
