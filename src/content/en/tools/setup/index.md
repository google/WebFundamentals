Set up your workspace to include a good editor, debugging, and build tools for the multi-device web.

Time is a huge factor in staying productive. Your development environment is where you spend most of yours. Set yourself up for success by including a strong, extensible editor and powerful debugging & development tools.

* [Setup Persistence with DevTools Workspaces](setup-workflow)
* [Setup CSS and JS Preprocessors](setup-preprocessors)
* [Setup Command Line Shortcuts](setup-shortcuts)
* [Setup Browser Extensions](setup-extensions)
* [Setup Your Build Tools](setup-buildtools)

When you're done, continue to learn more about the [Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools)](/web/tools/chrome-devtools), Chrome's built-in tool that helps you develop, test, and debug your pages.
