# Avoids Mutation Events In Its Own Scripts  {: .page-title }

## Overview {: #overview }

The following mutation events harm performance and are deprecated in the
DOM events spec:

* `DOMAttrModified`
* `DOMAttributeNameChanged`
* `DOMCharacterDataModified`
* `DOMElementNameChanged`
* `DOMNodeInserted`
* `DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument`
* `DOMNodeRemoved`
* `DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument`
* `DOMSubtreeModified`

## Recommendations {: #recommendations }

Under **URLs**, Lighthouse reports each mutation event listener that it found
in your code. Replace each of these mutation events with a `MutationObserver`.
See [`MutationObserver`][mdn] on MDN for more help.

## More information {: #more-info }

Lighthouse collects all of the event listeners on the page, and flags
any listener that uses one of the types listed above.
