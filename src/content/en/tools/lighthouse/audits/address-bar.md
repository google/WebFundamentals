# Address Bar Matches Brand Colors  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Theming the browser's address bar to match your brand's colors provides
a more immersive user experience.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

To ensure that the address bar is always themed to your colors:

1. Add a `theme-color` meta tag to the HTML of every page you want to brand.
1. Add the `theme_color` property to your Web App Manifest.

The `theme-color` meta tag ensures that the address bar is branded when
a user visits your site as a normal webpage. Set `content` to any valid CSS
color value. You need to add this meta tag to every page that you want to
brand.

    <head>
      <meta name="theme-color" content="#317EFB"/>
      ...

See [Support for theme-color in Chrome 39 for Android][theme-color] to
learn more about `theme-color`.

[theme-color]: /web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android

The `theme_color` property in your Web App Manifest ensures that the address
bar is branded when a user launches your progressive web
app from the homescreen. Unlike the `theme-color` meta tag, you only need
to define this once, in the manifest. The browser colors every page of your
app according to the manifest's `theme_color`. Set the property to any valid
CSS color value.

    {
      "theme_color": "#317EFB"
      ...
    }

See [Manifest Exists](manifest-exists#how) for more resources on adding a
manifest to your app.

{% include "web/tools/lighthouse/audits/implementation-heading.html" %}

The audit passes if Lighthouse finds a `theme-color` meta tag in the page's
HTML and a `theme_color` property in the Web App Manifest. Lighthouse does
not test whether the values are valid CSS color values.
