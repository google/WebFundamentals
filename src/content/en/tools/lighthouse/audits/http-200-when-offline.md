# URL Responds With a 200 When Offline {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Progressive web apps work offline. If Lighthouse does not receive an HTTP 200
response when accessing a page while offline, then the page is not accessible
offline.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

1. Add a service worker to your app.
2. Use the service worker to cache files locally.
3. When offline, use the service worker as a network proxy to return the
   locally cached version of the file.

To learn how to add a service worker into an existing app, see [Adding a Service
Worker and Offline Into Your Web
App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/offline). Use what you
learn in this step-by-step, hands-on codelab to learn how to add a service
worker into your own app. This covers steps 1 and 3 above.

The codelab above shows you some basics on how to debug your service worker
using Chrome DevTools. For more detailed help, see the codelab dedicated to
this topic, [Debugging Service
Workers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/debugging-service-workers).

Use the [Offline Cookbook](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/) to
determine which caching strategy fits your app best. This covers step 2 above.

Lighthouse emulates an offline connection using the Chrome Debugging Protocol,
and then attempts to retrieve the page using `XMLHttpRequest`.
