# Manifest Contains Theme Color  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

When a user accesses your app on Chrome for Android, the `theme_color` property
of your Web App Manifest determines the color of the address bar. This takes
effect whether or not the user has added your app to the homescreen.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

Add a `theme_color` property in your Web App Manifest. The value can be any
valid CSS color.

    {
      ...
      "theme_color": "cornflowerblue",
      ...
    }

Check out [Manifest Exists](manifest-exists#how)
for a list of guides that teach you how to properly
implement and test "Add to Homescreen" support in your app.

{% include "web/tools/lighthouse/audits/implementation-heading.html" %}

Audit passes if the manifest contains a `theme_color` property.
The manifest that Lighthouse fetches is separate from the one that Chrome is
using on the page, which can possibly cause inaccurate results. Lighthouse does
not validate that the value is a valid CSS color.
