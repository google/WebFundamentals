# Every Form Element Has A Label  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Labels clarify the purpose of form elements. Although the purpose of each
element may be obvious for sighted users, this is often not the case for
users who rely on screen readers.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

<<_shared/query.md>>

Associate a label to every form element. There are four ways to do so.

Implicit labels:

    <label>First Name <input type="text"/></label>

Explicit labels:

    <label for="first">First Name <input type="text" id="first"/></label>

`aria-label`:

    <button class="hamburger-menu" aria-label="menu">...</button>

`aria-labelledby`:

    <span id="foo">Select seat:</span>
    <custom-dropdown aria-labelledby="foo">...</custom-dropdown>
