# Every Image Element Has An Alt Attribute  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Every image should have an `alt` attribute that includes a text description
of the contents of that image. Screen readers enable visually-impaired users
to use your site by converting text content to forms they can use, such as
synthesized speech or Braille. Screen readers can't convert images. So if your
images include important information, that information is not accessible to
visually-impaired users.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

<<_shared/query.md>>

Add an `alt` attribute to every `img` element that does not have one.
You can run the following command in the DevTools Console to find the elements:

    $$('img:not([alt])');

Note: `$$()` is equivalent to `document.querySelectorAll()`.

DevTools returns an array. Expand the array and then hover over each `img`
to highlight it in the viewport.

When writing a description for each image, keep in mind that this is all the
information that visually-impaired users have to go by, so try to make it as
useful as possible for them.
