# Page Is Blocked From Indexing  {: .page-title }

## Overview {: #overview }

Search engines crawl your page in order to understand your content. If you don't
give them permission to crawl your page, they can't know what your page
contains, and therefore are less likely to list your pages in the results they
present to users.

<!-- Report UI: If you don't give search engines permission to crawl your pages,
they are less likely to list your pages in search results for user. -->
