# Document Doesn't Have A Title Element  {: .page-title }

## Overview {: #overview }

Note: This audit occurs in both the Accessibility and SEO categories of your
Lighthouse report.

### Accessibility {: #accessibility }

The document title provides an overview of a page's purpose. The title is
especially important for users who rely on screen readers, because they have
less context about the page.

See [Documents must have `<title>` element to aid in navigation][a11y]{:.external}
for more discussion about the accessibility aspects of this audit.

### SEO {: #seo }

Search users rely heavily on document titles. It's often the primary piece of
information for deciding whether a page is relevant to a query.

## Recommendations {: #recommendations }

Make sure that every page has a title.

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Create Good Titles</title>
      </head>
      ...
    </html>

If you've got a big site, use the [HTML Improvements Report][HIR]{:.external}
to crawl the site and discover any page that's missing a title.

Tips for creating great titles:

* Make them descriptive and concise. Avoid vague descriptions like `Home`.
* Avoid keyword stuffing. It's not helpful to users, and search engines may
  mark the page as spam.
* Avoid repeated or boilerplate titles.
* It's OK to brand your titles, but do it concisely.

See [Create descriptive page titles][CDPT]{:.external} for more on these tips.
