# Element ARIA Attributes Are Allowed For This Role  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Invalid role-attribute combinations can disable the accessibility of your
page.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

<<_shared/query.md>>

To find each element's invalid combination(s):

1. Note the `role` and `aria-*` attributes of the element.

1. Go to [Definition of Roles][roles].

1. Go to the page for this element's `role`.

1. Check the `aria-*` attributes of the element against the **Required
   States and Properties** or **Supported States and Properties** lists. Any
   attribute that is not in one of these two lists is invalid.

To fix the invalid combo, you can either remove the invalid attributes from
the element, or change the role of the element to one that supports the
attributes.
