## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Web SQL is deprecated. See [Web SQL Database][spec] to learn more.

[spec]: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

Consider replacing your Web SQL database with a modern alternative, such as
[IndexedDB][indexeddb].

See [Web Storage Overview][overview] for a discussion of other available
storage options.
