# Critical Request Chains  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

The Critical Request Chain is a concept from the Critical Rendering Path (CRP)
optimization strategy. CRP enables the browser to load a page as quickly as
possible by prioritizing which resources get loaded and the order in which
they load.

Check out the [Critical Rendering
Path](/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/) docs to learn
more.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

This audit is currently not structured as something to "pass" or "fail". The
information that this audit provides gives you an opportunity to improve
the page load performance of your app.

In the Chrome Extension version of Lighthouse, your report generates a diagram
like the following:

<pre>
Initial navigation
|---lighthouse/ (developers.google.com)
    |---/css (fonts.googleapis.com) - 1058.34ms, 72.80KB
    |---css/devsite-googler-buttons.css (developers.google.com) - 1147.25ms, 70.77KB
    |---jsi18n/ (developers.google.com) - 1155.12ms, 71.20KB
    |---css/devsite-google-blue.css (developers.google.com) - 2034.57ms, 85.83KB
    |---2.2.0/jquery.min.js (ajax.googleapis.com) - 2699.55ms, 99.92KB
    |---contributors/kaycebasques.jpg (developers.google.com) - 2841.54ms, 84.74KB
    |---MC30SXJEli4/photo.jpg (lh3.googleusercontent.com) - 3200.39ms, 73.59KB
</pre>

This diagram represents the page's critical request chains. The path from
`lighthouse/` to `/css` is one chain. The path from `lighthouse/` to
`css/devsite-googler-buttons.css` is another chain. And so on. The top-most
score of the audit represents this number of chains. For example, the diagram
above would have a "score" of seven.

The diagram also breaks down how much time was spent downloading each
resource, and the number of bytes that was required to download each resource.

You can use this diagram to improve your CRP by:

* Minimizing the number of critical resources: eliminating them, deferring
  their download, marking them as async, and so on.
* Optimizing the number of critical bytes to reduce the download time (number
  of roundtrips).
* Optimizing the order in which the remaining critical resources are loaded:
  downloading all critical assets as early as possible to shorten the critical
  path length.

Optimizing any of these factors results in a faster page load.

Lighthouse uses network priority as a proxy for identifying render-blocking
critical resources. See [Chrome Resource Priorities and
Scheduling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCDuq9H1ih9iNjgzyAL0gpwNFiEP4TZS-YLRp_RuMlc)
for more information on how Chrome defines these priorities.

Data on critical request chains, resource sizes, and time spent downloading
resources is extracted from the Chrome Debugger Protocol.
