# Element ARIA Attributes Are Valid  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Misspelled or nonexistent ARIA attributes may be preventing the screen reader
from properly understanding the current state of a widget. This could make the
page unusable to users who rely on screen readers.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

<<_shared/query.md>>

To find each listed element's invalid attribute names:

1. Note the `role` and `aria-*` attributes of the element.

1. Go to [Definition of Roles][roles].

1. Go to the page for this element's `role`.

1. Check the actual attributes on the element against the supported attributes,
   as listed in **Required States and Properties** and **Supported States
   and Properties**.
