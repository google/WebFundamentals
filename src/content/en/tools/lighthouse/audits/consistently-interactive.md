# Consistently Interactive {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

The Consistently Interactive metric measures when a page is *fully* interactive:

* The page strictly meets the [Idle guideline of the RAIL performance model][I]:
  the page yields control back to the main thread at least once every 50ms.
* The network is idle. Specifically, there are only two open network requests
  remaining.

[I]: /web/fundamentals/performance/rail#idle

Note: Maximizing idle time also indirectly improves [Response][R] time.
The more idle time there is, the more likely that the page will be able
to respond to user input in the target time of 100ms or less.

[R]: /web/fundamentals/performance/rail#response

See also [First Interactive](first-interactive).

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

To improve your Consistently Interactive score:

* Minimize the number of required or "critical" resources that must be
  downloaded or executed before the page can load. See [Critical Rendering
  Path][CRP].
* Minimize the size of each critical resource. See [Optimizing Content
  Efficiency][OCE].
* Maximize idle time so that your JavaScript spends no more than 50ms at
  a time executing tasks in the main thread. See [Optimizing JavaScript
  Execution][OJE].

The score is a lognormal distribution of some complicated calculations based on
the definition of the Consistently Interactive metric. See [First Interactive
And Consistently Interactive][FIACI] for definitions.
