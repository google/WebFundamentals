## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Page load is a key aspect of how a user perceives the performance of your
page. See [Measure Performance with the RAIL Method](/web/fundamentals/performance/rail) for more information.

This audit identifies the time at which the user feels that the primary
content of the page is visible.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

The lower your First Meaningful Paint score, the faster that the page
appears to display its primary content.

[Optimizing the Critical Rendering Path](/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/)
is particularly helpful towards achieving a faster First Meaningful Paint.

First Meaningful Paint is essentially the paint after which the biggest
above-the-fold layout change has happened, and web fonts have loaded. See the
spec to learn more:
