# Site Does Not Use document.write() {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

For users on slow connections, such as 2G, 3G, or slow Wi-Fi, external
scripts dynamically injected via `document.write()` can delay the display of
main page content by tens of seconds.

See [Intervening against `document.write()`][blog] to learn more.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

In your report, Lighthouse lists out every call to `document.write()`.
Review this list, and note any call that dynamically injects a script.
If the script meets the criteria outlined in the introduction to
[Intervening against `document.write()`][blog], Chrome won't execute the
injected script. These are the calls to `document.write()` that you want
to change. See [How do I fix this?][fix] for possible solutions.

{% include "web/tools/lighthouse/audits/implementation-heading.html" %}

Lighthouse reports every instance of `document.write()` that it encounters.
Note that Chrome's intervention against `document.write()` only applies to
render-blocking, dynamically-injected scripts. Other uses of `document.write()`
may be acceptable.
