# Document Doesn't Use Legible Font Sizes  {: .page-title }

## Overview {: #overview }

Font sizes smaller than 12px are often difficult to read on mobile devices, and may require users
to pinch-to-zoom in order to display the text at a comfortable reading size.

## Recommendations {: #recommendations }

Aim to have a font size of at least 12px on at least 60% of the text on your pages. 
When a page fails the audit, Lighthouse lists the results in a table with 4 columns:

* **Source**. The source location of the CSS ruleset that is causing the illegible text.
* **Selector**. The selector of the ruleset.
* **% of Page Text**. The percentage of text on the page that is affected by the ruleset.
* **Font Size**. The computed size of the text.

### Text is illegible because of a missing viewport config {: #viewport }

If Lighthouse reports `Text is illegible because of a missing viewport config`, add a
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` tag to the `<head>` of
your document. See [Has A Viewport Meta Tag With Width Or Initial-Scale][viewport].
