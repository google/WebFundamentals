# Estimated Input Latency  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

Input responsiveness is a key factor in how users perceive the performance
of your app. Apps have 100ms to respond to user input. Any longer than that,
and the user perceives the app as laggy. See [Measure Performance with the RAIL
Model](/web/fundamentals/performance/rail) for more information.

See the [What the audit tests for](#what) section of this doc for an
explanation of why this audit tests for a target score of 50ms (rather than
100ms, which is what the RAIL model recommends).

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

To make your app respond to user input faster, you need to optimize how
your code runs in the browser. Check out the series of techniques outlined
in the [Rendering Performance](/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/)
docs. These tips range from offloading computation to web workers in order
to free up the main thread, to refactoring your CSS selectors to perform
less calculations, to using CSS properties that minimize the amount of
browser-intensive operations.

One important caveat of this audit is that it's not a complete measurement of
input latency. As explained in the [What this doc tests for](#what) section
of this doc, this audit does not measure how long your app truly takes
to respond to a user input. In other words, it does not measure that your app's
response to the user's input is visually complete.

To measure this manually, make a recording with the
Chrome DevTools Timeline. See [How to use the Timeline
Tool](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/timeline-tool) for more
help. The basic idea is to start a recording, perform the user input that
you want to measure, stop the recording, and then analyze the flame chart
to ensure that all stages of [the pixel
pipeline](/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/#the_pixel_pipeline) are
complete within 50ms.

The RAIL performance model recommends that apps respond to user input within
100ms, whereas Lighthouse's target score is 50ms. Why?

The reason is that Lighthouse uses a proxy metric to measure how well your
app responds to user input: availability of the main thread. Lighthouse
assumes that your app needs 50ms to completely respond to the user's input
(from performing any JavaScript executions to physically painting the new
pixels to the screen). If your main thread is unavailable for 50ms or more,
that does not leave enough time for your app to complete the response.

There is a 90% probabililty a user would encounter input latency of the
amount that Lighthouse reports, or less. 10% of users can expect additional
latency.
