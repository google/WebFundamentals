# Elements With ARIA Roles Have Required Attributes  {: .page-title }

## Why the audit is important {: #why }

The `role` attribute helps screen readers understand the purpose of an ARIA
widget. A `role` may have a set of required, additional attributes that
describe the state of the widget to the screen reader.

## How to pass the audit {: #how }

<<_shared/query.md>>

To find each element's missing required attributes:

1. Note the `role` and `aria-*` attributes of the element.

1. Go to [Definition of Roles][roles].

1. Go to the page for this element's `role`.

1. Check the `aria-*` attributes of the element against the **Required
   States and Properties** list.

1. Add any attributes that are missing.
