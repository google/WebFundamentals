| Call Stack | For events with [child events](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/evaluate-performance/timeline-tool#view-nested-events), the time taken by each category of events.|
| CPU time | How much CPU time the recorded event took.|
| Details | Other details about the event.|
| Duration (at time-stamp) | How long it took the event with all of its children to complete; timestamp is the time at which the event occurred, relative to when the recording started.|
