# Get Started with Debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/kaycebasques.html" %}

This step-by-step, interactive tutorial teaches you the basic
workflow for debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools. The tutorial shows you
how to debug one specific issue, but the general workflow you learn is helpful
for debugging all types of JavaScript bugs.

If you're using `console.log()` to find and fix bugs in your code, consider
using the workflow outlined in this tutorial instead. It's often much faster
and more effective.

## Step 1: Reproduce the bug {: #step-1 }

Reproducing the bug is always the first step to debugging.
To "reproduce the bug" means to find a series of actions that consistently
causes the bug to appear. You may need to reproduce the bug many times,
so try to eliminate any unnecessary steps.

Follow along with the instructions below to reproduce the bug that you're going
to fix in this tutorial.

1. Click **Open Demo**. The demo opens in a new tab.

     <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/debug-js/get-started"
       target="devtools"
       rel="noopener noreferrer">
       <button>Open Demo</button>
     </a>

1. On the demo, enter `5` for **Number 1**.
1. Enter `1` for **Number 2**.
1. Click **Add Number 1 and Number 2**.
1. Look at the label below the inputs and button. It says `5 + 1 = 51`.

Whoops. That result is wrong. The result should be `6`. This is the bug that
you're going to fix.

## Step 2: Pause the code with a breakpoint

DevTools lets you pause your code in the middle of its execution, and
examine the values of *all* variables at that moment in time. The tool for
pausing your code is called a **breakpoint**. Try it now:

1. Open DevTools on the demo by pressing
   <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Mac) or
   <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows, Linux).

1. Click the **Sources** tab.

1. Click **Event Listener Breakpoints** to expand the section. DevTools reveals
   a list of expandable event categories, such as **Animation** and
   **Clipboard**.

1. Next to the **Mouse** event category, click **Expand** ![Expand
   icon](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/expand.png){: .devtools-inline}.
   DevTools reveals a list of mouse events, such as **click**,
   with checkboxes next to them.
1. Check the **click** checkbox.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/get-started-click-breakpoint.png"
         alt="DevTools opened on the demo, with the Sources panel in focus
              and click event listener breakpoints enabled."
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 1</b>: DevTools opened on the demo, with the
         Sources panel in focus and click event listener breakpoints enabled.
         If your DevTools window is large, the location of the <b>Event
         Listener Breakpoints</b> pane is on the right, rather than the
         bottom-left, like in the screenshot.
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Back on the demo, click **Add Number 1 and Number 2** again. DevTools
   pauses the demo and highlights a line of code in the **Sources** panel.
   DevTools highlights this line of code:

       `function onClick() {`

When you checked the **click** checkbox, you set up an event-based breakpoint on
all `click` events. When *any* node is clicked, and that node has a `click`
handler, DevTools automatically pauses on the first line of that node's
`click` handler.

Note: This is just one of the many types of breakpoints that DevTools offers.
What breakpoint you should use depends on what type of issue you're debugging.

## Step 3: Step through the code

One common cause of bugs is when a script executes in the
wrong order. Stepping through your code enables you to walk through your
code's execution, one line at a time, and figure out exactly where it's
executing in a different order than you expected. Try it now:

1. On the **Sources** panel of DevTools, click **Step into next function
   call** ![Step into next function call][into]{:.devtools-inline} to step
   through the execution of the `onClick()` function, one line at a time.
   DevTools highlights the following line of code:

       `if (inputsAreEmpty()) {` 

1. Click **Step over next function call** ![Step over next function
   call][over]{:.devtools-inline}. DevTools executes `inputsAreEmpty()`
   without stepping into it. Notice how DevTools skips a few lines of code.
   This is because `inputsAreEmpty()` evaluated to false, so the `if`
   statement's block of code didn't execute.

That's the basic idea of stepping through code. If you look at the code in
`get-started.js`, you can see that the bug is probably somewhere in the
`updateLabel()` function. Rather than stepping through every line of code,
you can use another type of breakpoint to pause the code closer to the
location of the bug.

## Step 4: Set another breakpoint

Line-of-code breakpoints are the most common type of breakpoint. When
you've got a specific line of code that you want to pause on, use a
line-of-code breakpoint. Try it now:

1. Look at the last line of code in `updateLabel()`, which looks like this:

       `label.textContent = addend1 + ' + ' + addend2 + ' = ' + sum;`

1. To the left of this code, you can see the line number of this particular
   line of code: **32**. Click on **32**. DevTools puts a blue icon on top
   of **32**. This means that there is a line-of-code breakpoint on this line.
   DevTools now always pauses before this line of code is executed.
1. Click **Resume script execution** ![Resume script
   execution][resume]{:.devtools-inline}. The script continues executing
   until it reaches the line of code you placed the breakpoint on.
1. Look at the lines of code in `updateLabel()` that have already executed.
   DevTools prints out the values of `addend1`, `addend2`, and `sum`.

The value of `sum` looks suspicious. It looks like it's being evaluated as
a string, when it should be a number. This may be the cause of the bug.

{% include "web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/_feedback/4.html" %}

## Step 5: Check variable values

Another common cause of bugs is when a variable or function produces
a different value than expected. Many developers use `console.log()` to
see how values change over time, but `console.log()` can be tedious and
ineffective for two reasons. One, you may need to manually edit your code
with lots of calls to `console.log()`. Two, you may not know exactly which
variable is related to the bug, so you may need to log out many variables.

One DevTools alternative to `console.log()` is Watch Expressions. Use
Watch Expressions to monitor the value of variables over time.
As the name implies, Watch Expressions aren't just limited to variables. You
can store any valid JavaScript expression in a Watch Expression. Try it now:

1. On the **Sources** panel of DevTools, click **Watch**. The section expands.
1. Click **Add Expression** ![Add Expression][add]{:.devtools-inline}.
1. Type `typeof sum`.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. DevTools shows `typeof sum: "string"`. The value
   to the right of the colon is the result of your Watch Expression.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/get-started-watch-expression.png"
         alt="The Watch Expression pane."
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 1</b>: The Watch Expression pane (bottom-right), after
         creating the <code>typeof sum</code> Watch Expression.
         If your DevTools window is large, the Watch Expression pane is on
         the right, above the <b>Event Listener Breakpoints</b> pane.
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

As suspected, `sum` is being evaluated as a string, when it should be a
number. This is the cause of the demo's bug.

A second DevTools alternative to `console.log()` is the Console. Use the
Console to evaluate arbitrary JavaScript statements.
Developers commonly use the Console to overwrite the variable values
when debugging. In your case, the Console can help you test out potential
fixes for the bug you just discovered. Try it now:

1. If you don't have the Console drawer open, press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to open
   it. It opens at the bottom of your DevTools window.
1. In the Console, type `parseInt(addend1) + parseInt(addend2)`.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. DevTools evaluates the statement and prints out
   `6`, which is the result you expect the demo to produce.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/get-started-console.png"
         alt="The Console drawer, after evaluating a statement."
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 1</b>: The Console drawer, after evaluating
         <code>parseInt(addend1) + parseInt(addend2)</code>.
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

{% include "web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/_feedback/5.html" %}

## Step 6: Apply a fix

You've identified a potential fix for the bug. All that's left is to try out
your fix by editing the code and re-running the demo. You don't
need to leave DevTools to apply the fix. You can edit JavaScript code directly
within the DevTools UI. Try it now:

1. In the code editor on the **Sources** panel of DevTools, replace
   `var sum = addend1 + addend2` with
   `var sum = parseInt(addend1) + parseInt(addend2);`. This is one line
   above where you are currently paused.
1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Mac) or
   <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Windows, Linux) to save your change.
   The background of the code changes to red to indicate that the script has
   been changed within DevTools.
1. Click **Deactivate breakpoints** ![Deactivate
   breakpoints][deactivate]{:.devtools-inline}. It changes blue to indicate
   that it is active. While this is set, DevTools ignores any breakpoints
   you've set.
1. Click **Resume script execution** ![Resume script
   execution][resume]{:.devtools-inline}.
1. Try out the demo with different values. The demo should now be calculating
   the sums correctly.

Keep in mind that this workflow only applies a fix to the code that is
running in your browser. It won't fix the code for all users that run your
page. To do that, you need to fix the code that's running on the servers
that serve your page.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You now know the basics of debugging JavaScript in DevTools.

This tutorial only showed you two ways to set breakpoints. DevTools offers many
other ways, including:

* Conditional breakpoints that are only triggered when the condition that you
  provide is true.
* Breakpoints on caught or uncaught exceptions.
* XHR breakpoints that are triggered when the requested URL matches a
  substring that you provide.
