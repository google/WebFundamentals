In other words, you're paused on the <code>click</code> event handler of your extension. Try clicking <img src="/web/tools/chrome-devtools/images/resume-script-execution.png" class="devtools-inline" alt="Resume Script Execution"/>. DevTools resumes execution until it encounters another <code>click</code> event handler. It should eventually pause on the correct line of code.</p><p>If that doesn't fix it, please <a href="{{url}}">open an issue</a> and tell us what happened.</p>{% endsetvar %}
