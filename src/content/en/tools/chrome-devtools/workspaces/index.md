# Edit Files With Workspaces {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/kaycebasques.html" %}

<aside class="objective">
  <b>Goal</b>: This tutorial provides hands-on practice in setting up and using Workspaces so
  that you can use Workspaces in your own projects. Workspaces enable you to save changes that
  you make within DevTools to source code that's stored on your computer.
</aside>

<aside class="caution">
  <b>Prerequisites</b>: Before beginning this tutorial, you should know how to:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web"
      class="external">Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web page</a>.

## Overview {: #overview }

Workspaces enable you to save a change that you make in Devtools to a local copy of the same file
on your computer. For example, suppose:

* You have the source code for your site on your desktop.
* You're running a local web server from the source code directory, so that the
  site is accessible at `localhost:8080`.
* You've got `localhost:8080` open in Google Chrome, and you're using DevTools to change the
  site's CSS.

With Workspaces enabled, the CSS changes that you make within DevTools are saved to the
source code on your desktop.

## Limitations {: #limitations }

If you're using a modern framework, it probably transforms your source code from a format
that's easy for you to maintain into a format that's optimized to run as quickly as possible.
Workspaces is usually able to map the optimized code back to your original source code with
the help of [source maps][maps]{:.external}. But there's a lot of variation between frameworks
over how they use source maps. Devtools simply can't support all the variations.

Workspaces is known to not work with these frameworks:

* Create React App

[maps]: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps

If you run into issues while using Workspaces with your framework of choice, or you get it working
after some custom configuration, please [start a thread in the mailing list][ML]{:.external} or
[ask a question on Stack Overflow][SO]{:.external} to share your knowledge with the rest of the
DevTools community.

## Related feature: Local Overrides {: #overrides }

[Local Overrides][LO] is another DevTools feature that is similar to Workspaces. Use Local
Overrides when you want to experiment with changes to a page, and you need to see those
changes across page loads, but you don't care about mapping your changes to the page's source
code.

## Step 1: Setup {: #setup }

Complete this tutorial to get hands-on experience with Workspaces.

### Set up the demo {: #demo }

1. <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/workspaces" class="external gc-analytics-event"
   data-category="DevTools" data-label="Workspaces / Opened Demo" data-value="1">Open the
   demo</a>. In the top-left of the editor, there's a randomly-generated project name.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/glitch.png"
            alt="A Glitch project with a randomly-generated name."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 1</b>. A Glitch project with a randomly-generated name
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Click the randomly-generated project name. For example, in **Figure 1** you would click
   **desert-cycle**.
1. Select **Advanced Options** > **Download Project**.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/download.png"
            alt="The Download Project button."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 2</b>. The <b>Download Project</b> button, highlighted in blue
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Close the tab.
1. Unzip the source code and move the unzipped `app` directory to your desktop. For the rest
   of this tutorial this directory will be referred to as `~/Desktop/app`.
1. Start a local web server in `~/Desktop/app`. Below is some sample code for starting
   up `SimpleHTTPServer`, but you can use whatever server you prefer.

    <pre class="prettyprint">
    <code class="devsite-terminal">cd ~/Desktop/app</code>
    <code class="devsite-terminal">python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> # Python 2
    <code class="devsite-terminal">python -m http.server</code> # Python 3
    </pre>

1. Open a tab in Google Chrome and go to locally-hosted version of the site. You should be
   able to access it via a URL like `localhost:8080`. The exact [port number][port]{:.external}
   may be different.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/demo.png"
            alt="The demo."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 3</b>. The demo
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

### Set up DevTools {: #devtools }

1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> (Mac) or 
   <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open
   the **Console** panel of DevTools.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/console.png"
            alt="The Console panel."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 4</b>. The <b>Console</b> panel
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Click the **Sources** tab.
1. Click the **Filesystem** tab.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/filesystem.png"
            alt="The Filesystem tab."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 5</b>. The <b>Filesystem</b> tab
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Click **Add Folder To Workspace**.
1. Select `~/Desktop/app`.
1. Click **Allow** to give DevTools permission to read and write to the directory.
   In the **Filesystem** tab, there is now a green dot next to `index.html`, `script.js`, and
   `styles.css`. These green dots mean that DevTools has established a mapping between the
   network resources of the page, and the files in `~/Desktop/app`.


     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/mapping.png"
            alt="The Filesystem tab now shows a mapping between the local files and the network
                 ones."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 6</b>. The <b>Filesystem</b> tab now shows a mapping between the local files
         and the network ones
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

## Step 2: Save a CSS change to disk {: #css }

1. Open `~/Desktop/app/styles.css` in a text editor. Notice how the `color` property of `h1`
   elements is set to `fuchsia`.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/fuchsia.png"
            alt="Viewing styles.css in a text editor."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 7</b>. Viewing <code>styles.css</code> in a text editor
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Close the text editor.
1. Back in DevTools, click the **Elements** tab.
1. Change the value of the `color` property of the `<h1>` element to your favorite color.
   Remember that you need to click the `<h1>` element in the **DOM Tree** in order to see the
   CSS rules applied to it in the **Styles** pane. The green dot next to `styles.css:1` means
   that any change you make will get mapped to `~/Desktop/app/styles.css`.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/green.png"
            alt="Setting the color property of the h1 element to green."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 8</b>. Setting the <code>color</code> property of the <code>h1</code> element
         to <code>green</code>
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Open `~/Desktop/app/styles.css` in a text editor again. The `color` property is now
   set to your favorite color.
1. Reload the page. The color of the `<h1>` element is still set to your favorite color. This
   works because when you made the change, DevTools saved the change to disk. And then, when you
   reloaded the page, your local server served the modified copy of the file from disk.

## Step 3: Save an HTML change to disk {: #html }

### Try changing HTML from the Elements panel {: #elements }

Warning: The workflow that you're about to try doesn't work. You're trying it now so that
you don't waste time later trying to figure out why it's not working.

1. Click the **Elements** tab.
1. Double click the text content of the `h1` element, which says `Workspaces Demo`, and replace
   it with `I ❤️  Cake`.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/cake.png"
            alt="Attempting to change HTML from the DOM Tree of the Elements panel"/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 9</b>. Attempting to change HTML from the <b>DOM Tree</b> of the <b>Elements</b>
         panel
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Open `~/Desktop/app/index.html` in a text editor. The change that you just made isn't there.
1. Reload the page. The page reverts to its original title.

#### Optional: Why it doesn't work {: #why }

Note: This section describes why the workflow from [Try changing HTML from the Elements
panel](#elements) doesn't work. You can skip this section if you don't care why.

* The tree of nodes that you see on the **Elements** panel represents the page's
  [DOM][DOM]{:.external}.
* To display a page, a browser fetches HTML over the network, parses the HTML, and then
  converts it into a tree of DOM nodes.
* If the page has any JavaScript, that JavaScript may add, delete, or change DOM nodes. CSS
  can change the DOM, too, via the [`content`][content]{:.external} property.
* The browser eventually uses the DOM to determine what content it should present to browser
  users.
* Therefore, the final state of the page that users see may be very different from the HTML
  that the browser fetched.
* This makes it difficult for DevTools to resolve where a change made in the **Elements**
  panel should be saved, because the DOM is affected by HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

In short, the **DOM Tree** `!==` HTML.

### Change HTML from the Sources panel {: #sources }

If you want to save a change to the page's HTML, do it via the **Sources** panel.

1. Click the **Sources** tab.
1. Click the **Page** tab.
1. Click **(index)**. The HTML for the page opens.
1. Replace `<h1>Workspaces Demo</h1>` with `<h1>I ❤️  Cake</h1>`. See <b>Figure 11</b>.
1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Mac) or
   <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to save the change.
1. Reload the page. The `<h1>` element is still displaying the new text.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/cakehtml.png"
            alt="Changing HTML from the Sources panel."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 11</b>. Line 12 has been set to <code>I ❤️  Cake</code>
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Open `~/Desktop/app/index.html`. The `<h1>` element contains the new text.

## Step 4: Save a JavaScript change to disk {: #js }

The **Sources** panel is also the place to make changes to JavaScript. But sometimes you need
to access other panels, such as the **Elements** panel or the **Console** panel, while making
changes to your site. There's a way to have the **Sources** panel open alongside other panels.

1. Click the **Elements** tab.
1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or
   <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS). The **Command
   Menu** opens.
1. Type `QS`, then select **Show Quick Source**. At the bottom of your DevTools window there is
   now a **Quick Source** tab. The tab is displaying the contents of `index.html`, which is the
   last file you edited in the **Sources** panel. The **Quick Source** tab gives you the editor
   from the **Sources** panel, so that you can edit files while having other panels open.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/commandmenu.png"
            alt="Opening the Quick Source tab via Command Menu."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 12</b>. Opening the <b>Quick Source</b> tab via the <b>Command Menu</b>
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows, Linux,
   Chrome OS) to open the **Open File** dialog. See **Figure 13**.
1. Type `script`, then select **app/script.js**.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/open.png"
            alt="Opening script.js via the Open File dialog."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 13</b>. Opening <code>script.js</code> via the <b>Open File</b> dialog
       </figcaption>
     </figure>

1. Notice the `Save Changes To Disk With Workspaces` link in the demo. It's styled regularly.
1. Add the following code to the bottom of **script.js** via the **Quick Source** tab.

    <pre class="prettyprint">
    console.log('greetings from script.js');
    <strong>document.querySelector('a').style = 'font-style:italic';</strong>
    </pre>

1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Mac) or
   <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to save the change.
1. Reload the page. The link on the page is now italic.

     <figure>
       <img src="imgs/italic.png"
            alt="The link on the page is now italic."/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 14</b>. The link on the page is now italic
       </figcaption>
     </figure>
