# Navigate Chrome DevTools With Assistive Technology {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/robdodson.html" %}

This guide aims to help users who primarily rely on assistive technology
like screen readers access and use [Chrome DevTools](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
Chrome DevTools is a suite of web developer tools built into the Google Chrome browser.
See [Accessibility Reference](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference) if you're
looking for DevTools features related to improving the accessibility of a web page.

The accessibility of DevTools is a work-in-progress. Some panels and tabs
work better with assistive technology than others. This guide
walks you through the panels which are the most accessible and highlights
specific issues you may encounter along the way.

## Overview {: #overview }

Before starting, it helps to have a mental model of how the DevTools UI
is structured. DevTools is divided into a series of *panels* which are
organized into an [ARIA `tablist`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tablist).
For example:

- The **Elements** panel lets you view and change
  [DOM nodes](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/) or [CSS](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css/).
- The [**Console** panel](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/) lets you read JavaScript
  logs and live edit objects.

Within the content area of each panel, there are a number of different
tools, often referred to as *tabs* or *panes* in the documentation.
For instance, the **Elements** panel contains additional tabs to inspect 
event listeners, the accessibility tree, and much more. The distinction between
tabs and panes is somewhat arbitrary. The only reason you'll see one term or the
other is to maintain consistency with the rest of the official DevTools documentation.

## Keyboard shortcuts {: #shortcuts }

The [DevTools Keyboard Shortcuts reference](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts) 
is a helpful cheatsheet. Be sure to bookmark it and refer back to it as you explore the different panels.

## Open DevTools {: #open }

To get started, read through [Open Chrome DevTools](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open).
There are a number of ways to open DevTools, either through keyboard shortcuts or menu items.

## Navigate between panels {: #panelnav }

### Navigate by keyboard {: #keynav }

* With DevTools open, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> or
  <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> (Mac) to focus the next panel. 
* Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> (Mac)
  to focus the previous panel.
* It's also possible to use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus into a panel's
  `tablist` and use the arrow keys to change panels, though it may be faster to use the
  previously mentioned shortcuts.

#### Known issues {: #keynavissues }

- Some panels, such as the **Console** and **Performance** panels, may move focus into
  their content area as soon as they are activated. This can make navigating by
  arrow keys difficult.

- The selected panel's name is announced, but only after it has read the
  focused content in the panel. This can make it very easy to miss.

### Navigate by Command Menu {: #commandmenunav }

To focus a specific panel, use the [**Command Menu**](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/ui#command-menu):

1. With DevTools open, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or
   <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) to open the **Command Menu**.
   The **Command Menu** is a fuzzy search autocomplete combobox.
1. Type the name of the panel you'd like to open, then use the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard
   to navigate to the correct option.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run a command.

For example, to open the **Elements** panel:

1. Open the **Command Menu**.
1. Type <kbd>E</kbd> then <kbd>L</kbd>. The **Panel > Show Elements** option is selected.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the command that opens the panel.

Opening a panel this way directs focus to the contents of the panel itself.
In the case of the **Elements** panel, focus moves into the **DOM Tree**.

## Elements panel {: #elements }

### Inspect an element on the page {: #inspect }

1. Navigate to the element you want to inspect using the screen reader's cursor.
1. Simulate a right-mouse click on the element to open the context menu.
1. Choose the **Inspect** option. This opens the
   [**Elements** panel](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/) and focuses the element in
   the **DOM Tree**.

The **DOM Tree** is laid out as an [ARIA `tree`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tree).
See [Navigate the **DOM Tree** with a keyboard](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/#keynav)
for an example.

### Copy the code for an element in the DOM Tree {: #outerhtml }

1. With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, bring up the right-click context menu.
1. Expand the **Copy** option.
1. Select **Copy outerHTML**.

#### Known issues {: #outerhtmlissues }

- **Copy outerHTML** often doesn't select the current node but instead selects its parent
  node. However, the contents of the element should still be in the copied
  outerHTML.

### Modify the attributes of an element in the DOM Tree {: #attributes }

* With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it editable.
* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between attribute values. When you hear "space" you are inside of
  an empty text input and can type a new attribute value.
* Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) to
  accept the change and hear the entire contents of the element.

#### Known issues {: #attributesissues }

- When you type into the text input you get no feedback. If you make a typo and
  use the arrow keys to explore your input you also get no feedback. The easiest
  way to check your work is to accept the change, then listen for the entire
  element to be announced.

### Edit the HTML of an element in the DOM Tree {: #nodetype }

* With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it editable.
* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between attribute values. When you hear the element's name, for
  instance, "h2", you are inside of a text input and may change the element's
  type.
* Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) to
  accept the change.

For example, typing `h3` and pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or 
<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) changes the element's start and end tags to `h3`.

## Elements panel tabs {: #elementstabs }

The **Elements** panel contains additional tabs for inspecting things like the CSS
applied to an element or its place in the accessibility tree.

* With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you hear that
  the **Styles** pane is selected. 
* Use the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to explore other available
  tabs.

The **DOM Tree** turns elements with `href` attributes into
focusable links, so you may need to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> more than once to reach the
Styles pane.

### Known issues {: #elementstabsissues }

The **DOM Breakpoints** and **Properties** tabs are not keyboard accessible.

### Styles pane {: #styles }

[active]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active
[focus]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus

In the **Styles** pane you'll find controls for filtering styles, toggling element
states (such as [`:active`][active] and [`:focus`][focus]), toggling classes, and adding new classes.
There is also a powerful style inspection tool to explore and modify styles
currently applied to the element that's in focus in the **DOM Tree**.

The key concept to understand about the **Styles** pane is that it only shows styles
for the currently-selected node in the **DOM Tree**. For example, suppose you're done
inspecting the styles of a `<header>` node, and now you want to look at the styles for
a `<footer>` node. To do that, you first need to select the `<footer>` node in the **DOM Tree**.
You might find it faster to use the <a href="#inspect">Inspect</a> workflow to
inspect a node that's in the general vicinity of the <code>footer</code> node (such as a link within
the footer), which focuses the **DOM Tree**, and then use your keyboard to navigate to the exact
node that you're interested in.

#### Navigate the Styles pane {: #stylesnav }

Because all of the style tools connect in one way or another back to the **Styles**
pane, it makes sense to master this tool first.

* With focus on the **Styles** pane, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus inside and explore
  its contents. 
* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the first style
  becomes active. If you're using a screen reader this first style will be
  announced as "element.style {}".
* Press <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to navigate the list of styles in order of specificity. A
  screen reader announces each style starting with the name of the CSS file,
  the line number that the style appears on, and the style name itself. For
  example: "main.css:233 .card__img {}"
* Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to inspect a style in more detail. Focus begins on an editable
  version of the style name.
* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between editable versions of each
  CSS property and their corresponding values. At the end of each style block is a
  blank editable text field which you may use to add additional CSS properties.
* You may continue to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move through the list of styles, or press
  <kbd>Escape</kbd> to exit this mode and go back to navigating by arrow keys.

Be sure to read through [the Styles pane keyboard reference](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts#styles)
for additional shortcuts.

##### Known Issues {: #stylesnavissues }

- If you use the **Filter** editable text field you will no longer be able to
  navigate the list of styles.

#### Toggle element state {: #togglestate }

To toggle an element's state, such as `:active` or `:focus`: 

1. Navigate to the **Styles** pane and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the **Toggle Element State** button has
   focus. 
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand the collection of element states. The element states are presented
   as a group of checkboxes. 
1. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the first state, `:active`, has focus.
1. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to enable it. If the currently-selected element in the DOM Tree has an `:active`
   style, it's now applied. 
1. Continue pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> to explore all of the available states.

#### Add an exiting class {: #addclass }

Adjacent to the **Toggle Element State** button is the **Element Classes** button.
Move focus to it by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> then <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Focus moves into an
edit text field labeled **Add New Class**.

The **Element Classes** button is primarily used for adding existing classes to an
element. For example, if your stylesheet contained a helper class named
`.clearfix` you could press `.` inside of the edit text field to see a
suggestion list of classes and use the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to find the `.clearfix`
suggestion. Or type the class name out yourself and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to apply it.

#### Add a new style rule {: #addrule }

Adjacent to the **Element Classes** button is the **New Style Rule** button. Move
focus to it by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Focus moves into an
editable text field inside of the style inspector. The initial text content of
the field is the tag name of the element that is selected in the **DOM Tree**.
You may type any class name you want into this field and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to
assign CSS properties to it.

### Computed tab {: #computed }

With focus on the [**Computed** tab](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css/reference#computed),
press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus inside and explore its contents.
Within the **Computed** tab there are controls for exploring which CSS properties
are actually applied to an element in order of specificity.

#### Explore all computed styles {: #explorecomputed }

Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you reach the collection of computed styles. These are
presented as an ARIA `tree`. Expanding a listbox reveals which CSS selectors
are applying the computed style. These selectors are organized by specificity.
A screen reader announces the computed value, which CSS selector is
currently matching, the filename of the stylesheet that contains the selector,
and the line number for the selector.

#### Known issues {: #explorecomputedissues }

- If you use the **Filter** text field you will no longer be able to inspect styles.

### Event listeners tab {: #listeners }

From within the **Elements** panel you may inspect the event listeners applied
to an element using the **Event Listeners** tab.
With focus on the **Styles** pane, press the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to navigate to the **Event
Listeners** tab.

#### Explore event listeners {: #explorelisteners }

Event listeners are presented as an ARIA `tree`. You may use the arrow keys to
navigate them. A screen reader announces the name of the DOM object that the
event listener is attached to, as well as the file name where the event listener
is defined and its line number.

### Accessibility pane {: #accessibility }

With focus on the [**Accessibility** pane](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference#pane),
press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus inside and explore its contents.
Within the **Accessibility** pane there are controls for exploring the accessibility
tree, the ARIA attributes applied to an element, and its computed accessibility
properties.

#### Accessibility Tree {: #accessibilitytree }

The **Accessibility Tree** is presented as an ARIA `tree` where each `treeitem`
corresponds to an element in the DOM.
The tree announces the computed role for the selected node.
Generic elements like `div` and `span` are announced as "GenericContainer"
in the tree.
Use the arrow keys to traverse the tree and explore parent-child relationships.

#### Known issues {: #accessibilitytreeissues }

- The type of ARIA tree used by the **Accessibility** pane may not be properly
  exposed in Chrome for macOS screen readers like VoiceOver. Subscribe to
  [Chromium issue #868480](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=868480)
  to be informed about progress on this issue.
- The **ARIA Attributes** and **Computed Properties** sections are marked up as ARIA
  trees, but they do not currently have focus management so they are not
  keyboard operable.

## Audits panel {: #audits }

The **Audits** panel let's you run a series of tests against a site to check
for common issues related to performance, accessibility, SEO, and a number of
other categories.

### Configure and run an audit {: #configureaudits }

1. When the **Audits** panel is first opened, focus is placed on the **Run Audit**
   button at the end of the form. By default the form is configured to run audits for every category
   using mobile emulation on a simulated 3G connection. 
1. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> or navigate back in Browse mode to change the audit settings.
1. When you're ready to run the audit, navigate back to the **Run Audit** button and
   press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 
1. Focus moves into a modal window with a **Cancel** button which
   allows you to exit the audit. You may hear a series of earcons as the audit runs
   and refreshes the page multiple times.

#### Known issues {: #configureauditsissues }

- The different sections of the configuration form are not currently marked up
  with a `fieldset` element. It may be easier to navigate them in Browse mode
  to figure out which controls are associated with each section.
- There is no earcon or live region announcement when the audit is finished
  running. Generally it takes about 30 seconds, after which you should be able
  to navigate to the results. Using Browse mode may be the easiest way to reach
  the results.

### Navigate the audit report {: #auditsnav }

The audit report is organized into sections that correspond with each of the
audit categories. The report opens with a list of scores for each category. These scores are also
links which can be used to skip to the relevant sections. Within each section are 
expandable `details` elements, which contain information
relating to passed or failed audits. By default, only failing audits are shown.
Each section ends with a final `details` element which contains all of the
passed audits.

To run a new audit, use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to exit the report and look for the **Perform
An Audit** button.
