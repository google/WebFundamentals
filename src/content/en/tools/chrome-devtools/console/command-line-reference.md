# Command Line API Reference {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/andismith.html" %}
{% include "web/_shared/contributors/megginkearney.html" %}

The Command Line API contains a collection of convenience functions for performing common
tasks: selecting and inspecting DOM elements, displaying data in readable format, stopping and
starting the profiler, and monitoring DOM events.

Note: This API is only available from within the console itself. You cannot access the Command
Line API from scripts on the page.


## $_

`$_` returns the value of the most recently evaluated expression.

In the following example,
a simple expression (`2 + 2`) is evaluated.
The `$_` property is then evaluated,
which contains the same value:

![$_ is the most recently evaluated expression](images/recently-evaluated-expression-1.png)

In the next example,
the evaluated expression initially contains an array of names.
Evaluating `$_.length` to find the length of the array,
the value stored in `$_` changes
to become the latest evaluated expression, 4:

![$_ changes when new commands are evaluated](images/recently-evaluated-expression-2.png)

## $0 - $4

The `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, `$3` and `$4` commands work as a historical reference to the last five
DOM elements inspected within the Elements panel
or the last five JavaScript heap objects selected in the Profiles panel.
`$0` returns the most recently selected element or JavaScript object,
`$1` returns the second most recently selected one, and so on.

In the following example,
an element with the class `medium` is selected in the Elements panel.
In the Console drawer, `$0` has been evaluated
and displays the same element:

![Example of $0](images/element-0.png)

The image below shows a different element selected in the same page.
The `$0` now refers to newly selected element,
while `$1` returns the previously selected one:

![Example of $1](images/element-1.png)

## $(selector) {: #queryselector }

`$(selector)` returns the reference to the first DOM element
with the specified CSS selector.
This function is an alias for the
[document.querySelector()](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/selectors_api/querySelector)
function.

The following example returns a reference
to the first `<img>` element in the document:

![Example of $('img')](images/selector-img.png)

Right-click on the returned result and
select 'Reveal in Elements Panel' to find it in the DOM,
or 'Scroll in to View' to show it on the page.

The following example returns a reference to the currently selected element and displays its src
property:

![Example of $('img').src](images/selector-img-src.png)

Note: If you are using a library such as jQuery that uses <code>$</code>, this functionality
will be overwritten, and <code>$</code> will correspond to that library's implementation.

## $$(selector) {: #queryselectorall }

`$$(selector)` returns an array of elements
that match the given CSS selector.
This command is equivalent to calling
[document.querySelectorAll()](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/selectors_api/querySelectorAll).

The following example uses `$$()` to create an array
of all `<img>` elements in the current document and
displays the value of each element's `src` property:

		var images = $$('img');
		for (each in images) {
			console.log(images[each].src);
		}

![Example of using $$() to select all images in the document and display their
sources.](images/all-selector.png)

Note: Press <kbd class='kbd'>Shift</kbd> + <kbd class='kbd'>Enter</kbd> in the console to start
a new line without executing the script.

## $x(path) {: #xpath }

`$x(path)` returns an array of DOM elements
that match the given XPath expression.

For example,
the following returns all the `<p>` elements on the page:

		$x("//p")

![Example of using an XPath selector](images/xpath-p-example.png)

The following example returns all the `<p>` elements 
that contain `<a>` elements:

		$x("//p[a]")

![Example of using a more complicated XPath selector](images/xpath-p-a-example.png)

## clear()

`clear()` clears the console of its history.

		clear();

## copy(object)

`copy(object)` copies a string representation of the specified object
to the clipboard.

		copy($0);

## debug(function)

When the specified function is called,
the debugger is invoked and breaks inside the function
on the Sources panel allowing to step through the code and debug it.

		debug(getData);

![Breaking inside a function with debug()](images/debug.png)

Use `undebug(fn)` to stop breaking on the function,
or use the UI to disable all breakpoints.

For more information on breakpoints,
see [Pause Your Code With
Breakpoints](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/breakpoints).

## dir(object)

`dir(object)` displays an object-style listing
of all the specified object's properties.
This method is an alias for the Console API's `console.dir()` method.

The following example shows the difference between
evaluating `document.body` directly in the command line,
and using `dir()` to display the same element:

		document.body;
		dir(document.body);

![Logging document.body with and without dir() function](images/dir.png)

For more information,
see the
[`console.dir()`](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console/console-reference#console.dir(object))
entry in the Console API.

## dirxml(object)

`dirxml(object)` prints an XML representation of the specified object,
as seen in the Elements tab.
This method is equivalent to the
[console.dirxml()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console) method.

## inspect(object/function) {:#inspect}

`inspect(object/function)` opens and selects the specified element
or object in the appropriate panel: either the Elements panel for DOM elements or the
Profiles panel for JavaScript heap objects.

The following example opens the `document.body` in the Elements panel:

		inspect(document.body);

![Inspecting an element with inspect()](images/inspect.png)

When passing a function to inspect,
the function opens the document up
in the Sources panel for you to inspect.

## getEventListeners(object)

`getEventListeners(object)` returns the event listeners registered
on the specified object.
The return value is an object that contains an array
for each registered event type ("click" or "keydown", for example).
The members of each array are objects
that describe the listener registered for each type.
For example,
the following lists all the event listeners
registered on the document object:

		getEventListeners(document);

![Output of using getEventListeners()](images/get-event-listeners.png)

If more than one listener is registered on the specified object,
then the array contains a member for each listener.
In the following example,
there are two event listeners registered on the #scrollingList element
for the "mousedown" event:

![Multiple listeners](images/scrolling-list.png)

You can further expand each of these objects to explore their properties:

![Expanded view of listener object](images/scrolling-list-expanded.png)

## keys(object)

`keys(object)` returns an array containing the names
of the properties belonging to the specified object.
To get the associated values of the same properties,
use `values()`.

For example,
suppose your application defined the following object:

		var player1 = { "name": "Ted", "level": 42 }

Assuming `player1` was defined in the global namespace (for simplicity), typing `keys(player1)`
and `values(player1)` in the console results in the following:

![Example of keys() and values() methods](images/keys-values.png)

## monitor(function)

When the function specified is called,
a message is logged to the console that indicates the function name
along with the arguments that are passed
to the function when it was called.

		function sum(x, y) {
			return x + y;
		}
		monitor(sum);

![Example of monitor() method](images/monitor.png)

Use `unmonitor(function)` to cease monitoring.

## monitorEvents(object[, events])

When one of the specified events occurs on the specified object,
the Event object is logged to the console.
You can specify a single event to monitor,
an array of events, or one of the generic events "types" mapped
to a predefined collection of events. See examples below.

The following monitors all resize events on the window object.

		monitorEvents(window, "resize");

![Monitoring window resize events](images/monitor-events.png)

The following defines an array to monitor both "resize" and "scroll" events on the window object:

		monitorEvents(window, ["resize", "scroll"])

You can also specify one of the available event "types",
strings that map to predefined sets of events.
The table below lists the available event types and
their associated event mappings:

<table class="responsive">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2">Event type &amp; Corresponding mapped events</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>mouse</td>
			<td>"mousedown", "mouseup", "click", "dblclick", "mousemove",
                            "mouseover", "mouseout", "mousewheel"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>key</td>
			<td>"keydown", "keyup", "keypress", "textInput"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>touch</td>
			<td>"touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend", "touchcancel"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>control</td>
			<td>"resize", "scroll", "zoom", "focus", "blur", "select", "change",
                            "submit", "reset"</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

For example,
the following uses the "key" event type all corresponding key events
on an input text field currently selected in the Elements panel.

		monitorEvents($0, "key");

Below is sample output after typing a characters in the text field:

![Monitoring key events](images/monitor-key.png)

## profile([name]) and profileEnd([name])

`profile()` starts a JavaScript CPU profiling session
with an optional name.
`profileEnd()` completes the profile and displays the results
in the Profile panel.
(See also
[Speed Up JavaScript Execution](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/rendering-tools/js-execution).)

To start profiling:

		profile("My profile")

To stop profiling and display the results in the Profiles panel:

		profileEnd("My profile")

Profiles can also be nested. For example, this will work in any order:

		profile('A');
		profile('B');
		profileEnd('A');
		profileEnd('B');

Result in the profiles panel:

![Grouped profiles](images/grouped-profiles.png)


Note: Multiple CPU profiles can operate at once and you aren't required to close them out
in creation order.

## table(data[, columns])

Log object data with table formatting by passing in a data object
in with optional column headings.
For example,
to display a list of names using a table in the console,
you would do:

		var names = {
			0: { firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith" },
			1: { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" }
		};
		table(names);

![Example of table() method](images/table.png)

## undebug(function)

`undebug(function)` stops the debugging of the specified function
so that when the function is called,
the debugger is no longer invoked.

		undebug(getData);

## unmonitor(function)

`unmonitor(function)` stops the monitoring of the specified function.
This is used in concert with `monitor(fn)`.

		unmonitor(getData);

## unmonitorEvents(object[, events])

`unmonitorEvents(object[, events])` stops monitoring events
for the specified object and events.
For example,
the following stops all event monitoring on the window object:

		unmonitorEvents(window);

You can also selectively stop monitoring specific events on an object.
For example,
the following code starts monitoring all mouse events
on the currently selected element,
and then stops monitoring "mousemove" events (perhaps to reduce noise in the console output):

		monitorEvents($0, "mouse");
		unmonitorEvents($0, "mousemove");

## values(object)

`values(object)` returns an array containing the values
of all properties belonging to the specified object.

		values(object);
