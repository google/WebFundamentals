The Chrome DevTools Console panel is your focal point for direct interaction with a page in real time.

The Console lets you use standard JavaScript statements and Console-specific commands while a page is live in the browser to help you debug the page. View diagnostic messages, display both raw and structured data, control and filter output, examine and modify page elements, measure execution time, and more.
