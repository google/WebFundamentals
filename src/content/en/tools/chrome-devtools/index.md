# Chrome DevTools {: .page-title }

Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.
DevTools can help you diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better
websites, faster.

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <iframe class="devsite-embedded-youtube-video" data-video-id="G_P6rpRSr4g"
          data-autohide="1" data-showinfo="0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

With DevTools you can view and change any page, even the Google homepage, as the video
demonstrates.

## Get started {: #get-started }

Here are the recommended starting points for some of the most common ways that DevTools
can help you build websites faster:

* [Viewing and changing a page's styles](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css/). Every developer goes
  through this experience: you code some CSS, and then you view your page and... the styles
  aren't being applied. Or, they look way different than you expect. This tutorial shows you how
  to use DevTools to see how the browser is actually applying styles to HTML elements. It also
  shows you how to change styles from DevTools, which applies the changes immediately without
  needing to reload your page.
* [Debugging JavaScript](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/). The first way that most
  developers learn how to debug is `console.log()`. This tutorial shows you how to set breakpoints
  in DevTools, which lets you pause in the middle of a page's execution and step through the
  code one line at a time. While you're paused, you can inspect (and even change) the current
  values of variables at that point in time. You may find that this workflow helps you
  debug issues much faster than the `console.log()` method.
* [Viewing messages and running JavaScript in the **Console**](console/get-started). The
  **Console** provides a chronological log of messages that give you more information about
  whether a page is running correctly. These messages come from the developers who built the
  page, or from the browser. You can also run JavaScript from the **Console** in order to
  inspect how a page is built, or experiment with changing how the page runs.
* [Optimizing website speed](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/speed/get-started). The Audits panel
  provides quantitative reports of your site speed, as well as concrete tips on how to improve it.

Browse the DevTools docs to learn about all the other things that DevTools can do for you.
The docs are organized by common tasks.

See [Join the DevTools community](#community) to learn about all the ways that you can
get help with how to use DevTools, or help others. If you ever have ideas on how to improve these
docs or the DevTools product itself, the DevTools team would love to hear your feedback!

## Discover DevTools {: #discover-devtools }

The DevTools UI can be a little overwhelming... there's so many tabs! But, if you take some
time to get familiar with each tab to understand what's possible, you may discover that DevTools
can seriously boost your productivity.

Note: In the DevTools docs, the top-level tabs are called panels.
