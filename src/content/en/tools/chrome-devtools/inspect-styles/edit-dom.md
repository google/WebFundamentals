The DOM tree view in the Chrome DevTools Elements panel displays the DOM structure of the current web page. Live-edit the content and structure of your page through DOM updates.


### TL;DR {: .hide-from-toc }
- The DOM defines your page structure. Each DOM node is a page element, for example, a header node, paragraph node.
- Live-edit the content and structure of your pages through the rendered DOM.
- But remember, you can't modify source files through DOM changes in the Elements panel. Reloading the page erases any DOM tree modifications.
- Watch for changes to the DOM using DOM breakpoints.


## Inspect an element {:#inspect-an-element}

Use the **Elements panel** to inspect all elements in your page in one
DOM tree. Select any element and inspect the styles applied to it.

<video autoplay muted src="animations/inspect-element.mp4">
</video>

There are several ways to inspect an element:

Right-click any element on the page and select **Inspect**.

![Inspect an element via right-click](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/imgs/right-click-inspect.png)

Press <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">Shift</kbd>
+ <kbd class="kbd">C</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd class="kbd">Cmd</kbd>
+ <kbd class="kbd">Shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">C</kbd> (Mac) to open
DevTools in Inspect Element mode, then hover over an element. DevTools
automatically highlights the element that you are hovering over in the
**Elements** panel. Click on the element to exit inspect mode while keeping the
element highlighted within the **Elements** panel. 

Click the **Inspect Element** button
![Inspect icon](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/imgs/inspect-icon.png){:.inline}
to go into Inspect Element Mode, then click on an element.

Use the [`inspect`][inspect] method in the console, such as
`inspect(document.body)`.

### View the rendered and natural sizes of an image {: #image-sizes }

Hover over an `img` tag in the **DOM Tree** to view the rendered and natural sizes of that
image.

![Rendered and natural image sizes](imgs/image-sizes.png)

### View which image in a source set (srcset) is being used {: #srcset }

To view which version of an image in a `srcset` was loaded, select the `img` element,
then evaluate `$0.currentSrc` in the **Console**.

Note: See [Enhance `img`s with `srcset` for high DPI devices][srcset] to learn more about image
optimization using `srcset`.

[srcset]: /web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/images#enhance_imgs_with_srcset_for_high_dpi_devices

![currentSrc in the Console][currentSrc console]

[currentSrc console]: /web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/imgs/currentSrc-console.png

Note: `$0` is a shortcut in the DevTools **Console**. It provides a reference to the
currently-selected element in the **DOM Tree**.

You can also view `currentSrc` via the **Properties** tab. The **Properties** tab only displays
properties for the currently-selected element, so make sure that you've selected the
correct element before viewing.

![currentSrc in the Properties tab][currentSrc properties]

## Navigate the DOM

Navigate through the DOM structure using your mouse or keyboard.

A collapsed node has an arrow next to it pointing right:
![collapsed node](imgs/collapsed-node.png){:.inline}

An expanded node has an arrow next to it pointing down:
![expanded node](imgs/expanded-node.png){:.inline}

Using your mouse:

* Click once to highlight a node.
* To expand a node, double-click anywhere on it or click on the arrow next  
  to it.
* To collapse a node, click on the arrow next to it.

Using your keyboard:

* Press the **Up Arrow** key to select the node above the current one.
* Press the **Down Arrow** to select the node below the current one.
* Press the **Right Arrow** key to expand a collapsed node. Press
  it again to move to the first child of the (now-expanded) node. You can 
  use this technique to quickly navigate deeply-nested nodes.

### Navigate the breadcrumb trail

At the bottom of the Elements panel is a breadcrumb trail. 

![Breadcrumb trail](imgs/breadcrumb-body.png)

The currently selected node is highlighted in blue. The node to the left is
the current node's parent. And to the left of that is the parent's parent.
And so on, all the way up the tree.

![Extend breadcrumb trail](imgs/breadcrumb-footer.png)

Navigating back up the structure moves the highlight:

![Navigate up breadcrumb trail](imgs/breadcrumb-trail.png)

DevTools displays as many items as possible in the trail.
If the entire trail doesn't fit in the status bar, an ellipsis (...) 
shows where the trail has been truncated. Click the ellipsis to show the 
hidden elements:

![Breadcrumb ellipsis](imgs/breadcrumb-ellipsis.png)

## Edit DOM nodes and attributes

To edit a DOM node name or attribute:

* Double-click directly on the node name or attribute.
* Highlight the node, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>
  until the name or attribute is selected.
* Open the [more actions menu](#more-actions) and select **Add Attribute** 
  or **Edit Attribute**. **Edit Attribute** is context-sensitive; the portion 
  you click on determines what gets edited.

The closing tag is automatically updated when you're finished.

</video>

### Edit DOM node and its children as HTML

To edit a DOM node and its children as HTML:

* Open the [more actions menu](#more-actions) and select **Edit as HTML**. 
* Press <kbd>F2</kbd> (Windows / Linux) or <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> (Mac).
* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows / Linux) or 
  <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) to save your changes. 
* Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit the editor without saving.

![edit as HTML](imgs/edit-as-html.png)

## Move DOM node

Click, hold, and drag a node to move it.

<video autoplay muted src="animations/move-node.mp4">
</video>

## Delete DOM node

To delete a DOM node:

* Open the [more actions menu](#more-actions) and select **Delete Node**.
* Select the node and press the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key.

Note: If you delete a node by accident, <kbd class='kbd'>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class='kbd'>Z</kbd> (or <kbd class='kbd'>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd class='kbd'>Z</kbd> on Mac) to undo your last action.

## Show more actions menu {:#more-actions}

The **more actions** menu lets you interact with a DOM node in a variety
of ways. To view the menu, right-click on a node, or select a node
and then press the **more actions** button (![more action 
button](imgs/more-actions-button.png){:.inline})). The button is only 
displayed on the currently selected element.

![more actions menu](imgs/more-actions-menu.png)

## Scroll into view

When you hover over or select a DOM node, the rendered node is highlighted 
in the viewport. If the node is scrolled offscreen, you'll see
a tooltip at the top of the viewport if the node is above the
current viewport, and a tooltip at the bottom if the node is below the current
viewport. For example, in the screenshot below DevTools is indicating that the
currently selected element in the **Elements** panel is below the viewport.

![element below viewport](imgs/below-viewport.png)

To scroll the page so the node appears in the viewport,
**Right-click** the node and select **Scroll into View**.

## Set DOM breakpoints

Set DOM breakpoints to debug complex JavaScript applications.
For example, if your JavaScript is changing the styling of a DOM element,
set a DOM breakpoint to fire when the element's attributes are modified. Trigger a breakpoint on one of the following DOM changes: subtree change, attribute change, node removal.

{# include shared/related_guides.liquid inline=true list=page.related-guides.breakpoints #}

### Subtree Modifications

A subtree modification breakpoint is triggered when a child element is added, removed, or moved. For example, if you set a subtree modification breakpoint on the `main-content` element, the following code triggers the breakpoint:


    var element = document.getElementById('main-content');
    //modify the element's subtree.
    var mySpan = document.createElement('span');
    element.appendChild( mySpan );
    

### Attribute Modifications

An attribute modification occurs when the attribute of an element (`class, id, name`) is changed dynamically:


    var element = document.getElementById('main-content');
    // class attribute of element has been modified.
    element.className = 'active';
    

### Node Removal

A node removal modification is triggered when the node
in question is removed from the DOM:


    document.getElementById('main-content').remove();
    

## Interact with DOM breakpoints

The Elements and Sources panels both include a pane for managing your DOM 
breakpoints.

Each breakpoint is listed with an element identifier and the breakpoint type.

![DOM breakpoints pane](imgs/dom-breakpoints-pane.png)

Interact with each listed breakpoint in any of the following ways:

* **Hover** over the element identifier to show the element's corresponding 
  position on the page (similar to hovering over nodes in the Elements panel).
* **Click** an element to select it in the Elements panel.
* **Toggle** the checkbox to enable or disable the breakpoint.

When you trigger a DOM breakpoint, the breakpoint is highlighted in the DOM 
Breakpoints pane. The **Call Stack** pane displays the **reason** for a 
debugger pause:

![Breakpoint reason](imgs/breakpoint-reason.png)

## View element event listeners

View JavaScript event listeners associated with a DOM node in the 
**Event Listeners** pane. 

![event listeners pane](imgs/event-listeners-pane.png)

The top-level items in the Event Listeners pane show the event types that 
have registered listeners.

Click the arrow next to the event type (for example `click`) to see 
a list of registered event handlers. Each handler is identified by a CSS 
selector-like element identifier, such as `document` or 
`button#call-to-action`. If more than one handler is registered for the 
same element, the element is listed repeatedly.

Click the expander arrow next to an element identifier to see the properties of the event handler. The Event Listeners pane lists the following properties for each listener:

<table class="responsive">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Event Listener Properties &amp; Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  	<tr>
      <td data-th="Value"><code>handler</code></td>
      <td data-th="Description">Contains a callback function. Right-click on the function and select <strong>Show Function Definition</strong> to view where the function is defined (if source code is available).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td data-th="Value"><code>useCapture</code></td>
      <td data-th="Description">A boolean value stating whether the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener">useCapture</a> flag on <code>addEventListener</code> was set.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note: Many Chrome extensions add their own event listeners onto the DOM. If you see a number of event listeners that aren't set by your code, you may want to reopen your page in an [Incognito window](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464). Incognito windows prevent extensions from running by default.

### View ancestor event listeners

When the **Ancestors** checkbox is enabled, the event listeners for the 
ancestors of the currently selected node are displayed, in addition to the
currently selected node's event listeners.

![ancestors enabled](imgs/ancestors-enabled.png)

When the checkbox is disabled, only the event listeners for the currently
selected node are displayed.

![ancestors disabled](imgs/ancestors-disabled.png)

### View framework listeners

  <script>
    $('#button').click(function() {
      $('#button').text('hehe, that tickled, thanks');
    });

Some JavaScript frameworks and libraries wrap native DOM events into their 
custom event APIs. In the past this made it hard to inspect the event listeners
with DevTools, because the function definition would just reference back to 
the framework or library code. The **Framework listeners** feature solves 
this problem.

When the **Framework listeners** checkbox is enabled, DevTools automatically
resolves the framework or library wrapping portion of the event code, and
then tells you where you actually bound the event in your own code.

![framework listeners enabled](imgs/framework-listeners-enabled.png)

When the **Framework listeners** checkbox is disabled, the event listener code
will probably resolve somewhere in the framework or library code.
