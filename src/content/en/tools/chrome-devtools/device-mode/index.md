# Simulate Mobile Devices with Device Mode {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/pbakaus.html" %}

Use Chrome DevTools' Device Mode to build mobile-first, fully responsive websites. Learn how to use it to simulate a wide range of devices and their capabilities.

Warning: Device Mode gives you a close approximation as to how your site
will look on a mobile device, but to get the full picture you should always
test your site on real devices. DevTools can't emulate the performance
characteristics of mobile devices, for example.


## In a nutshell

* Emulate your site across [different screen sizes and resolutions](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/emulate-mobile-viewports), including Retina displays.
* Responsively design by visualizing and [inspecting CSS media queries](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/media-queries).
* Evaluate your site's load performance with the [Network Conditions drawer](emulate-mobile-viewports#network), without affecting traffic to other tabs.
* Accurately [simulate device input](/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/device-input-and-sensors) for touch events, geolocation, and device orientation

## Toggle Device Mode {: #toggle }

Toggle the **Device Mode** button to turn Device Mode on or off.

![Initial start for device mode](imgs/device-mode-initial-view.png)

When Device Mode is on, the icon is blue
(![device mode on](imgs/device-mode-on.png)).

When it's off, the icon is grey
(![device mode off](imgs/device-mode-off.png)).

Device Mode is enabled by default. 

You can also toggle Device Mode by pressing
<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> (Mac) or
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> (Windows, Linux).
To use this shortcut your mouse needs to be focused on your DevTools window.
If it's focused on your viewport, you'll trigger [Chrome's switch user
shortcut](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179).
