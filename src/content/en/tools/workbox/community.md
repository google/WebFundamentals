# Community & Support

There are a few ways you learn more about plans for Workbox, help others,
and get support.

## Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a great place to asking and answering
questions on how to use Workbox.

If you do raise a question please use the
[workbox](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=workbox)
tag. This will help the community easily
[find](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/workbox) and answer your
questions.

## Slack

Once a week the Core Workbox team will be on Slack
for an hour or so to discuss upcoming changes as well
as future plans.

If you are interested in taking part please feel free to join
the **#workbox** room on the
[ChromiumDev Slack Channel](https://chromiumdev.slack.com/).

If you're not already a member of the channel, you can
[request access here](https://chromiumdev-slack.herokuapp.com/).

Times of when we'll be meeting are on the calendar below.
