            <h1>workbox-routing</h1>
            <p>It's common in service workers to want to assign specific behaviors and logic to a subset of requests that are received via the <code>fetch()</code> event.</p>
            <p>This library makes it easy to route requests to &quot;handlers&quot;, which can be existing behaviors from Workbox or functions for custom handling of a request.

              <p><code>ExpressRoute</code> is a helper class to make defining Express-style
                <a href="module-workbox-routing.Route.html">Routes</a> easy.</p>
              <p>Under the hood, it uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp"><code>path-to-regexp</code></a> library to transform the <code>path</code> parameter into a regular expression, which is then matched against the URL's path.</p>
              <p>Please note that <code>ExpressRoute</code> can match either same-origin or cross-origin requests.
              </p>
              <p>To match same-origin requests, use a <code>path</code> value that begins with
                <code>'/'</code>, e.g. <code>'/path/to/:file'</code>.</p>
              <p>To match cross-origin requests, use a <code>path</code> value that includes the origin, e.g. <code>'https://example.com/path/to/:file'</code>.</p>
              <h3 class="class-list"><a href="module-workbox-routing.NavigationRoute.html">NavigationRoute</a></h3>
              <p>NavigationRoute is a helper class to create a <a href="module-workbox-routing.Route.html">Route</a> that matches for browser navigation requests, i.e. requests for HTML pages.</p>
              <p>It will only match incoming requests whose <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode"><code>mode</code></a> is set to <code>navigate</code>.</p>
              <p>You can optionally only apply this route to a subset of navigation requests by using one or both of the <code>blacklist</code> and <code>whitelist</code> parameters. If both lists are provided, and there's a navigation to a URL which matches
                both, then the blacklist will take precedence and the request will not be matched by this route. The regular expressions in <code>whitelist</code> and <code>blacklist</code> are matched against the concatenated
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils/pathname"><code>pathname</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils/search"><code>search</code></a>                portions of the requested URL.</p>
              <p>To match all navigations, use a <code>whitelist</code> array containing a RegExp that matches everything, i.e. <code>[/./]</code>.</p>
              <h3 class="class-list"><a href="module-workbox-routing.RegExpRoute.html">RegExpRoute</a></h3>
              <p>RegExpRoute is a helper class to make defining regular expression based
                <a href="module-workbox-routing.Route.html">Routes</a> easy.</p>
              <p>The matching for regular expressioned are slightly different between same-origin requests and cross-origin requests.</p>
              <p>A common pattern is to use a regex pattern similar to <code>/styles/.*</code> to capture all stylesheets on your site.</p>
              <p>If we used this on <code>https://workboxjs.org</code>, this regular expression would match for the end of
                <code>https://workboxjs.org<strong>/styles/main.css</strong></code>.</p>
              <p>However, it's unlikely that we'd intend for this to match against:
                <code>https://third-party-origin.com<strong>/styles/example.css</strong></code>.</p>
              <p>To overcome this common issue, regular expressions will only match against cross-origin requests if the regular expression matches from the start.</p>
              <p>For example, matching the cross-origin example, we could change the regular expression to: <code>https://third-party-origin.com/styles/.*</code>, meaning we would now match <code><strong>https://third-party-origin.com/styles/example.css</strong></code>.</p>
              <p>If you wish your regular expression to match both, you just need to ensure you account for the full URL.</p>
              <h3 class="class-list"><a href="module-workbox-routing.Route.html">Route</a></h3>
              <p>A <code>Route</code> allows you to tell a service worker that it should handle certain network requests using a specific response strategy.</p>
              <p>A consists or a matcher and a handler. A matcher needs to determine if a route should be used for a request. A handler should handle the request if it does match a Router.</p>
              <p>Instead of implementing your own handlers, you can use one of the pre-defined runtime caching strategies from the
                <a href="module-workbox-runtime-caching.html">workbox-runtime-caching</a> module.</p>
              <p>There are also pre-defined Route's provided by this library:
                <a href="module-workbox-routing.RegExpRoute.html">RegExpRoute</a> and <a href="module-workbox-routing.ExpressRoute.html">ExpressRoute</a> subclasses which provide a convenient wrapper with a nicer interface for using regular expressions
                or Express-style routes as the <code>match</code> criteria.</p>
              <h3 class="class-list"><a href="module-workbox-routing.Router.html">Router</a></h3>
              <p>The Router takes one or more Routes and allows you to apply that routing logic to determine the appropriate way of handling requests inside of a service worker.</p>
              <p>It also allows you to define a &quot;default&quot; handler that applies to any requests that don't explicitly match a <code>Route</code>, and a &quot;catch&quot; handler that responds to any requests that throw an exception while being routed.</p>
              <p>You can use the <code>handleRequest()</code> method to pass a <code>FetchEvent</code> through the router and ultimately get a &quot;routed response&quot; back. If you'd like this to be handled automatically for you, calling
                <code>addFetchListener()</code> will cause the <code>Router</code> to respond to <code>fetch</code> events.</p>
              <p>If a request matches multiple routes, precedence will be given to the last-registered route.</p>
