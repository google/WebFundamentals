* `globPatterns` is a glob of what files to precache. In plain English, the
  wildcard pattern `**/*.{html,js}` translates to "cache every HTML and JS
  file in `globDirectory`, or any of its sub-directories".
* `swDest` is where Workbox outputs the service worker that it generates.
* `clientsClaim` instructs the latest service worker to take control of all
  clients as soon as it's activated. See [clients.claim][claim].
* `skipWaiting` instructs the latest service worker to activate as soon as it enters
  the waiting phase. See [Skip the waiting phase][skip].
