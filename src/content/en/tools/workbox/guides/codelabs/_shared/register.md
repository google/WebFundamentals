## Step 4: Register and inspect the generated service worker {: #register }

Workbox has generated a service worker, but there's no reference to it from
your app, yet.

1. Click `src/app.js` to open that file.
1. Register your service worker at the bottom of `init()`.

    <pre class="prettyprint">function init() {
      ...
      <strong>if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        window.addEventListener('load', () => {
          navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(registration => {
            console.log('SW registered: ', registration);
          }).catch(registrationError => {
            console.log('SW registration failed: ', registrationError);
          });
        });
      }</strong>
    }</pre>

1. Re-focus the tab that's running the live version of your app. In the DevTools **Console**
   you see a message indicating that the service worker was registered.
1. Click the **Application** tab of DevTools.
1. Click the **Service Workers** tab.

     </figure>

1. Click **sw.js**, next to **Source**. DevTools displays the
   service worker code that Workbox generated. It should look close to this:

### Try out the offline-capable app {: #try-incomplete }

Your app now sort-of works offline. Try it now:

1. In the live version of your app, use DevTools to go offline again.
   Focus DevTools and press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
   (Mac) or <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows, Linux)
   to open the **Command Menu**. Type `Offline`, select **Go offline**,
   then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Reload the page. The title of the page appears, but the list of the top
   10 stories doesn't.
1. Click the **Network** tab in DevTools. The request for `topstories.json` is
   red, meaning that it failed. This is why the list isn't appearing. The app
   tries to make a request for
   `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json`, but the request
   fails since you're offline and you haven't instructed Workbox to cache
   this resource, yet.

         alt="The incomplete offline experience"/>
       <figcaption>
         <b>Figure 8</b>. The incomplete offline experience

     </figure>

1. Use the **Command Menu** in DevTools to go back online.

### Optional: How the service worker code works {: #optional-generated }

The service worker code is generated based on your Workbox configuration.

* `importScripts('{% include "web/tools/workbox/_shared/workbox-sw-cdn-url.html" %}');`
  imports Workbox's service worker library. You can inspect this file from the **Sources** panel of
  DevTools.

        alt="The code for Workbox's service worker library"/>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

* The `self.__precacheManifest` array lists all of the resources that Workbox is
  precaching.
* Each resource has a `revision` property. This is how Workbox determines
  when to update a resource. Each time you build your app, Workbox generates
  a hash based on the contents of the resource. If the contents change, then
  the `revision` hash changes.
* When the service worker runs, it writes the `url` and `revision` of each
  resource to [IndexedDB][IDB] (IDB) if it doesn't exist. If the resource does
  exist, the service worker checks that the `revision` in its code matches the
  `revision` in IDB. If the hashes don't match, then the resource has changed,
  and therefore the service worker needs to download the updated resource and
  update the hash in IDB.

In sum, Workbox only re-downloads resources when they change, and ensures
that your app always caches the most up-to-date version of each resource.
