# Generate a Complete Service Worker {: .page-title }

Workbox can generate a complete service worker that supports precaching and set
up runtime caching purely from a configuration object or file. This is a great
option for anyone looking for an easy solution and works really well for static
sites.

You can generate a service worker using the CLI, workbox-build Node module or
with the webpack plugin.

Depending on how you build your site, youâ€™ll need to select the right tool for
you. The CLI is easiest to get up and running with. The Node Module
`workbox-build` is useful if you have a build process that runs in node,
like Gulp. If you use webpack, the Workbox plugin will be the best fit.

and will give you a better understanding of how the other tools work.</aside>
