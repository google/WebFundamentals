# Precache Files {: .page-title }

If you want your web app to work offline or there are assets you know can be
cached for a long time, precaching is the best approach.

Precaching a file will ensure that a file is downloaded and cached before a
service worker is installed, meaning that if your service worker is installed,
your files are cached.

Workbox provides an easy way to precache files, ensuring that as your service
worker changes, the precached files are maintained efficiently, only
downloading updated files and cleaning up after the service worker is made
redundant.

Precaching files with Workbox can be done like so:

```javascript
workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([
    '/styles/index.0c9a31.css',
    '/scripts/main.0d5770.js',
    { url: '/index.html', revision: '383676' },
]);
```

The above snippet will download the files `/styles/index.0c9a31.css`,
`/scripts/main.0d5770.js` and `/index.html` during the service worker install
event and create a route that serves these files directly from the cache.

This list of files is normally generated using a tool that manages the
versioning of files.

### Generating a Precache Manifest

Most users of Workbox will generate the list of files to precache by using
one of the following Workbox tools, although you can use any tool that outputs
files with revisioning. Below is a list of tools that can generate this
list of files.
