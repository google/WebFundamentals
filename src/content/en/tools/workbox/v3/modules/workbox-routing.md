## What is Workbox Routing?

A service worker can intercept network requests for a page. It may respond to
the browser with cached content,content from the network or content generated
in the service worker.

`workbox-routing` is a module which makes is easy to "route" these requests to
different functions that provide responses.

## How Routing is Performed

When a network request causes a service worker fetch event, `workbox-routing`
will attempt to respond to the request using the supplied routes and handlers.

![Workbox Routing Diagram](../images/modules/workbox-routing/workbox-routing-diagram.png)

The main things to note from the above is:

- The type of request is important.
    - By default, Routes are registered for 'GET' requests. If you wish to
    intercept other types of requests, you’ll need to specify the method.
- The order of the Route registration is important.
    - If multiple Routes are registered that could handle a request, the
    Route that is registered first will be used to respond to the Request.

There are a few ways to register a route, you can use callbacks, regular
expressions or Route instances each of which we’ll look at next.

## Matching and Handling in Routes

A "route" in workbox is nothing more than two functions a “matching” function
to determine if the route should match a request and a “handling” function,
which should handle the request and respond with a Response.

Workbox comes with some helpers that’ll perform the matching and handling for
you, but if you ever find yourself wanting different behaviour, writing a
custom match and handler function is the best option.

A match function will be given a FetchEvent and a URL object and you can
match against a request by returning a truthy value. For a simple example,
you could match against a specific URL like so:

```javascript
const matchCb = ({url, event}) => {
  return (url.pathname === '/special/url');
};
```

Most use cases can be covered by examining / testing either the `url` or the
`event.request` to match against a Request.

A "handler" will be given the url and event as well and you can determine how
to respond, whether it’s from the network, from the cache or generated in the
service worker.

```javascript
const handlerCb = ({url, event, params}) => {
  return fetch(event.request)
  .then((response) => {
    return response.text();
  })
  .then((responseBody) => {
    return new Response(`${responseBody} <!-- Look Ma. Added Content. -->`);
  });
};

```

Your handler must return a Promise that resolves to a Response. The `params`
value is is the value of any value returned by the "match" function. This may
be useful is you parsed the URL or request and want to pass that values into
the “handler” for a matching request.

You can register these callbacks via like so:

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(matchCb, handlerCb);
```

The only limitation is that "match" **must synchronously** return a truthy
value, you can’t perform any asynchronous work. The reason for this is that
the Router must synchronously respond to the fetch event or allow falling
through to other fetch events.

The "handler" callback should return a Promise that resolves to a
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).
Where that Response comes from is up to you, the network, a cache or
generated in the service worker.

Normally the "handler" callback would use one of the strategies provided
by `workbox-runtime-caching` like so:

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(matchCb, workbox.stratgies.staleWhileRevalidate());
```

In this page we’ll focus on `workbox-routing` but you can
[learn more about these strategies on workbox.strategies](./workbox-strategies).

## How to Register a Regular Expression Route

A common practice is to skip avoid using the "match" callback and instead use
a Regular Expression to match requests.

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(new RegExp('/styles/.*\.css'), handlerCb);
```

For requests from the
[same origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy),
this route will be used as long as part of the request’s URL matches the
regular expression.

- https://example.com<span style="color: #2ecc71">/styles/main.css</span>
- https://example.com<span style="color: #2ecc71">/styles/nested/file.css</span>
- https://example.com/nested<span style="color:#2ecc71">/styles/directory.css</span>

However, for cross-origin requests, regular expressions
**must match the beginning of the URL**. The reason for this is that it’s
unlikely that with a regular expression `new RegExp('/styles/.*\.css')`
you intended to match a third-parties CSS files.

- <span style="color: #e74c3c">https://cdn.third-party-site.com</span><span style="color: #2ecc71">/styles/main.css</span>
- <span style="color: #e74c3c">https://cdn.third-party-site.com</span><span style="color: #2ecc71">/styles/nested/file.css</span>
- <span style="color: #e74c3c">https://cdn.third-party-site.com/nested</span><span style="color: #2ecc71">/styles/directory.css</span>

If you *did* want this behaviour, you just need to ensure that regular
expression matches the beginning of the URL. If we wanted to match the
requests for `https://cdn.third-party-site.com` we could use the regular
expression `new RegExp('https://cdn.third-party-site.com.*/styles/.*\.css')`.

- <span style="color: #2ecc71">https://cdn.third-party-site.com/styles/main.css</span>
- <span style="color: #2ecc71">https://cdn.third-party-site.com/styles/nested/file.css</span>
- <span style="color: #2ecc71">https://cdn.third-party-site.com/nested/styles/directory.css</span>

If you wanted to match both local and third parties you can use a wildcard
at the start of your regular expression, but this should be done with caution
to ensure it doesn’t cause unexpected behaviors in you web app.

## How to Register a Navigation Route

If your site is a single page app, you can use a
[NavigationRoute](../reference-docs/latest/workbox.routing.NavigationRoute) to
return a specific response for all
[navigation requests](/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/high-performance-loading#first_what_are_navigation_requests).

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerNavigationRoute('/single-page-app.html');
```

Whenever a user goes to your site in the browser, the request for the page
will be a navigation request and will be served the cached page
'/single-page-app.html'. (Note: should have the page cached via
`workbox-precaching` or through your own installation step).

By default this will respond to *all* navigation requests, if you want to
restrict it to respond to a subset of URL’s you can use the `whitelist`
and `blacklist` options to restrict which pages will match this route.

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerNavigationRoute('/single-page-app.html', {
  whitelist: [
    new RegExp('/blog/')
  ],
  blacklist: [
    new RegExp('/blog/restricted/'),
  ]
});
```

The only thing to note is that the `blacklist` will win if a URL is in both
the `whitelist` and `blacklist`.

## Set a Default Handler

If you want to supply a "handler" for requests that don’t match a route, you
can set a default handler.

```javascript
workbox.routing.setDefaultHandler(({url, event, params}) => {
  ...
});
```

## Set a Catch Handler

In the case of any of your routes throwing an error, you can capture and
degrade gracefully by setting a catch handler.

```javascript
workbox.routing.setCatchHandler(({url, event, params}) => {
  ...
});
```

## Defining a Route for Non-GET Requests

All routes by default are assumed to be for 'GET' requests.

If you would like to route other requests, like a 'POST' request, you need
to define the method when register the request, like so:

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  matchCb,
  handlerCb,
  'POST'
);
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  new RegExp('/api/.*\.json'),
  handlerCb,
  'POST'
);
```

## Router Logging

You should be able to determine the flow of a request using the logs from
`workbox-routing` which will highlight which URLs are being processed
through Workbox.

![Routing Logs](../images/modules/workbox-routing/workbox-routing-standard-logs.png)

If you need more verbose information you can set the log level to `debug` to
view logs on requests not handled by the Router. See our
[debugging guide](../guides/how-to-troubleshoot-and-debug) for more info on
setting the log level.

![Debug and Log Routing Messages](../images/modules/workbox-routing/workbox-routing-logs.png)

## Advanced Usage

If you want to have more control over when the Workbox Router is given
requests you can create your own
[Router](../reference-docs/latest/workbox.routing.Router) instance and call
it’s [handleRequest()](../reference-docs/latest/workbox.routing.Router#handleRequest)
method whenever you want to use the router to respond to a request.

```javascript
const router = new DefaultRouter();
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  const responsePromise = router.handleRequest(event);
  if (responsePromise) {
    // Router found a route to handle the request
    event.respondWith(responsePromise);
  } else {
    // No route found to handle the request
  }
});
```

When using the `Router` directly you will also need to use the `Route` class,
or any of the extending classes to register routes.

```javascript
const router = new DefaultRouter();
router.registerRoute(new Route(matchCb, handlerCb));
router.registerRoute(new RegExpRoute(new RegExp(...), handlerCb));
router.registerRoute(new NavigationRoute(handlerCb));
```
