      Workbox is a set of service worker libraries and Node modules.

      The service worker libraries can be loaded and used within a service worker to
      make it easy to handle network requests and take full advantage of the service
      worker API's and events.

      The Node modules make it easy to precache files efficiently for
      your users, a vital step to making your site work offline.
