## What is Cache Expiration?

It’s fairly common to want to put restrictions on a cache in terms of how long
if should allow items to be stored in a cache or how many items should be kept
in a cache. Workbox provides this functionality through the
`workbox-cache-expiration` plugin that allows you to limit the number of
entries in a cache and / or remove entries that have been cached for a long
period of time.

## Restrict the Number of Cache Entries

To restrict the number of entries stored in a cache you can use the
`cacheExpiration` option like so:

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  new RegExp('/images/'),
  workbox.strategies.cacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'image-cache',
    cacheExpiration: {
      maxEntries: 20,
    },
  })
);
```

With this, the
[CacheExpirationPlugin](../reference-docs/latest/workbox.expiration.CacheExpirationPlugin)
will be added to this route. After a cached response is used or a new request
is added to the cache the plugin will look at the configured cache and ensure
that the number of cached entries doesn’t exceed the limit. If it does,
**the oldest entries will be removed**.

## Restrict the Age of Cached Entries

To restrict how long a request is cached for you can define a max age in
seconds like so;

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  /\/images\//,
  workbox.strategies.cacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'image-cache',
    cacheExpiration: {
      maxAgeSeconds: 20,
    },
  })
);
```

The plugin will check and remove entries after each request or cache update.

One thing to note:

- Because it’s slow to open IndexedDB, expiration won’t occur until
*after* the request is used. This means that an expired request may be
used once, but will be expired after that.
- To alleviate this, the plugin will check the "Date" header of the cached
response, if one exists and the date can be parsed, it’ll expire based on this
as it doesn’t require an IndexedDB lookup..

## Advanced Usage

Above discusses the common usage of `workbox-cache-expiration` which is
largely abstracted behind configuration, but you can use the underlying
classes to use as a normal Workbox plugin or use the logic seperate from
any other Workbox modules.

### Using the Plugin Directly

The plugin can be instantiated and used like so:

```javascript
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  new RegExp('/images/'),
  workbox.strategies.cacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'image-cache',
    plugins: [
      new workbox.expiration.CacheExpirationPlugin({
        maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60,
        maxEntries 20,
      }),
    ],
  })
);
```

### Using Just the Cache Expiration Logic

If you’d like to use the expiration logic separate from any other Workbox
modules you can do so with the
[CacheExpiration](../reference-docs/latest/workbox.expiration.CacheExpiration)
class.

To apply restrictions to a cache, you’d create an instance of `CacheExpiration`
for the cache you want to control like so:

```javascript
const cacheName = 'my-cache';
const expirationManager = new workbox.expiration.CacheExpiration(
  cacheName,
  {
    maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60,
    maxEntries 20,
  }
);
```

Whenever you update a cached entry, you need to call the `updateTimestamp()`
method so that it’s age is updated.

```javascript
openCache.put(
  request,
  response
);

expirationManager.updateTimestamp(request.url);
```

Then whenever you want to expire a set of entries you can call the
`expireEntries()` method which will enforce the `maxAgeSeconds` and
`maxEntries` configuration.

```javascript
expirationManager.expireEntries();
```
