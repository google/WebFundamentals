This page contains examples for some of the Workbox modules.

Workbox is a set of small modules that can be used on their own, but we've
also combined the most common pieces into one module, `workbox-sw`. This module
supports precaching, routing of fetch events, runtime caching and more.

## workbox-sw

The `workbox-sw` example demonstrates a complete service worker
implementation, demonstrating the common parts of the API. It's an in-depth
exploration of everything you'd need to build a production-ready service worker.

## Lower Level Modules

As an alternative to using the full `workbox-sw` library, you can use these
smaller, standalone modules in your service worker.


#### workbox-broadcast-cache-update

Uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/broadcast_channel_api">Broadcast Channel API</a>
to let you know when two responses are different.

#### workbox-cache-expiration

Takes care of expiring cached entries based on the maximum number or age of
entries.

#### workbox-routing

Makes it easy to handle network requests using the response strategy of your
choice.
