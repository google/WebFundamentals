# Web Payments / The Payment Ecosystem {: .page-title }

_The goal of this document is to provide a common context of how the payment system works 
and a high-level picture of the ecosystem. The target audience is developers working on 
merchants, payment gateways, and related payment industries._

## The Players

Let's take a high-level look at the general Web Payments workflow. To understand how the 
Web Payments ecosystem works, we should first get to know the players. There are usually 
four participants in the process.

- _Customers_ -- users who want to purchase something online
- _Merchants_ -- businesses who have a product to sell
- _Payment Service Providers (PSPs)_ -- third-party companies who actually process payments 
from customers to merchants
- _Payment Apps_ -- applications that, working with the browser, help customers supply 
payment information required to complete the transaction

## How the Payment Request Process Works

The typical sequence of events for those players as they create and process a web payment 
might look like this.

1. A customer visits a merchant's website, finds one or more items they would like to buy, 
and commits to a purchase.
1. The merchant needs payment information to receive the customer's money, so they use the 
Payment Request API to collect the information from the customer. A payment app helps the 
customer provide payment information; this could just be the browser itself providing a raw 
credit card number, or it could be a third-party payment app like Google Pay, Apple Pay, or 
Samsung Pay. It can also optionally request the customer's shipping address and contact 
information.
1. The browser launches (for example) the Google Pay app for the customer to choose a card 
number to pay with. This step is completely up to the payment app's implementation. If the 
customer authorizes the payment, Google Pay returns a token (payment credential) to the 
Payment Request API, which relays it to the merchant site.
1. The merchant site sends the payment credential to a PSP to process the payment and initiate 
the funds transfer. Usually, verifying the payment on the server side is also required.
1. The PSP processes the payment, securely requesting a funds transfer from the customer's 
bank or credit card issuer to the merchant, and then returns a success or failure result to 
the merchant website.
1. The merchant website notifies the customer of the payment result and displays the next step 
in the process, e.g., shipping the purchased item.

## What are Payment Methods?

Payment methods are processes that can be invoked to process a payment, and can be thought of 
like plugins for the Payment Request API. Each payment method consists of a required payment 
method identifier and an optional detail parameter.

There are two types or categories of payment methods, called _Standardized_ and _URL-based_; 
these are discussed in 
[Payment Methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13hYK7-ddiRpD-VdD05310ZTUxrfUZ3Zj911NofaFc6I/edit?ts=5b075b04#).

## What are Basic Card and Payment Apps?

The basic-card method is just that: support for basic card networks, currently including Visa, 
Mastercard, and JCB (formerly Japan Credit Bureau). A list of supported networks can be found at 
[this W3C page](https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids) 
(although Web Payments may not yet support all of the networks on the list).

Payment apps are applications provided by third-party _payment app providers_, who play a key 
role in the web payments ecosystem. These are the apps that implement the payment methods. 

For example, an app can provide a raw (unencrypted) credit card number. The browser has one 
such app built-in. 

Alternatively, an app can provide tokenized credit card information. For both raw credit card 
numbers and tokenized credit card information, the merchant initiates the transfer of funds. 

Or, a bank app can transfer money to another bank. In this case, the payment app provider 
initiates the funds transfer.

## PSP Reliance

PSPs have been, and remain, an important link in the payment processing chain. Implementing 
Web Payments does not obviate the need for a PSP.

Merchants usually rely on a third-party PSP to perform payment processing, for convenience 
and expense reasons. This is primarily because most PSPs maintain compliance with the 
[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard), 
an information security standard maintained and administered by the 
[PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). 

Because achieving and maintaining strict PCI DSS compliance is expensive and difficult, 
most merchants find that relying on a compliant PSP avoids going through the certification 
process themselves. Some large and financially robust companies, however, obtain their own 
PCI DSS certification specifically to avoid such third-party reliance.

Delegating payment processing to a PCI DSS-compliant PSP, then, both simplifies the merchant 
site's payment processing requirements and ensures payment information integrity for the customer.

Ask your PSP if you can use the Payment Request API through their SDK; if not, ask them to 
support it.
