# Web Payments / How the API Works {: .page-title }

_The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of the Payment Request API, 
as it's not necessarily required to implement by a developer (they might use PG's SDK 
instead). The target audience is developers working on merchants, payment gateways, and 
related payment industries._

## Payment Request API

When a customer wants to purchase something from your merchant website, the site must 
ask the customer to provide required payment information and, optionally, additional 
information such as shipping preference. This customer request is accomplished via the 
[Payment Request API (PR API)](https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/).

Much 
[basic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Afo0lsqksPNPSdkiSTuSDMm68x5XfMM4UPf7mbYwrgU/edit), 
[detailed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API), 
[deep dive](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/payments/deep-dive-into-payment-request), 
and even 
[UX](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/payments/payment-request-ux-considerations) 
information has been written about the PR API, which we won't repeat here. The goal of this 
document is to show you, the merchant website owner, how to implement the PR API in general 
terms, without getting bogged down in minutia.

Thus the code in this document is basic: not meant to be copy/pasted for direct use, but 
intended to be understood in terms of _what it does_ rather than _how it works_.

## Basic Fields

Constructing a `PaymentRequest` requires three parameters: _payment methods_, _payment details_, 
and _payment options_. A basic request could be created like this.

```javascript
var request = new PaymentRequest(methods, details, options);
```

Let's look at how each parameter is built and used.

### Payment Methods

The first parameter, _methods_, is specified as a list of supported methods in an array variable. 
Each element in the array comprises two components, _supportedMethods_ and, optionally, _data_. 

The existence and content of _data_ depends on the content of _supportedMethods_, as in the 
example below. The first method, `basic-card`, is a 
[standardized method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13hYK7-ddiRpD-VdD05310ZTUxrfUZ3Zj911NofaFc6I/edit?ts=5b075b04#) 
and requires `data` to list the supported card types; the second method, 
`https://bobpay.xyz/pay`, is a URL-based payment method and (in this case) requires no 
additional `data` values.

```javascript
// Supported payment methods
var methods = [{
  supportedMethods: 'basic-card',
  data: {
    supportedNetworks: [
      'visa', 'mastercard', 'amex', 'discover',
      'diners', 'jcb', 'unionpay'
    ]
  }
}, {
  supportedMethods: 'https://bobpay.xyz/pay',
}];
```

### Payment Details

The second parameter, _details_, is passed as an object. It contains the required value 
`total`, which specifies the total amount due from the customer. This parameter can also 
optionally list the purchased items and, if desired, the current shipping options (not 
covered in this brief overview).

In the example below, the optional purchased items list (just one item, in this case) 
is shown, as is the required total amount due. In both cases the currency unit is 
specified along with the individual value.

```javascript
var details = {
  displayItems: [{
    label: 'Anvil L/S Crew Neck - Grey M x1',
    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '22.15' }
  }],
  total: {
    label: 'Total due',
    amount: { currency: 'USD', value : '22.15' }
  }
};
```

### Payment Options

The third parameter, _options_, is a simple object containing flags indicating which 
options the customer should be asked to provide. Also, the shipping address type -- 
_delivery_ or _pick up_ -- can be specified in this parameter.

In the example below, the user will be asked to provide a shipping address, an email 
address, a phone number, and a name, and the shipping type is set to specify the 
shipping address as _delivery_.

```javascript
var options = {
  requestShipping: true,
  requestPayerEmail: true,
  requestPayerPhone: true,
  requestPayerName: true,
  shippingType: 'delivery'
};
```

### The show() Method

After setting the three parameters and creating the `request` object as shown above, 
you can call the `show()` method, which displays the Payment Request user interface.

```javascript
request.show().then(response => {
  // [process payment]
  // send to a PSP etc.
  response.complete('success');
});
```

The customer selects the payment method, presses **Pay**, and is asked to authorize the 
payment. This action produces an object that contains all the information the user entered 
through the UI, as well as payment details from the chosen payment method. You can then send 
the completed payment information to a PSP in order to process the payment.

In the example below, the response contains all of the information required to initiate 
the payment via a PSP.

```javascript
{ // example response
  "methodName": "basic-card",
  "details": {
    "cardholderName": "Larry Page",
    "cardNumber": "4111111111111111",
    "expiryMonth": "12",
    "expiryYear": "2020",
    "cardSecurityCode": "111",
    "billingAddress": { ... }
  },
  "shippingAddress": { ... }
  "shippingOption": "express",
  "payerName": "Larry Page",
  "payerPhone": "212-555-1212",
  "payerEmail": "user@example.com"
}
```
