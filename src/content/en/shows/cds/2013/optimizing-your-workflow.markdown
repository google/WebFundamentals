If we have to develop for Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, wearables and other form factors, how can you optimise your workflow to make your life less stressful? There's a solid multi-device approach for quick iteration with LiveReload, Grunt, Yeoman, and the newly-unveiled [Mini Mobile Device Lab](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/MiniMobileDeviceLab). Lastly, if you don't have the physical hardware you want to test, some providers make it available through the cloud.

## Key points

+  The number of devices that we are going to have to cater for is only going to increase
+  Getting your workflow with the right with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
+  Simplify cross browser and cross device testing with [Mini Mobile Device Lab](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/MiniMobileDeviceLab)
+  Be smart with your emulation choice using Chrome DevTools Emulation, Stock Emulators, Cloud Based Emulators like [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/), [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) and [Device Anywhere](http://www.deviceanywhere.com/) and third party emulator [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)
+ Mobile testing means more than just testing on your wifi connection, use a proxy to simulate slower network speeds
