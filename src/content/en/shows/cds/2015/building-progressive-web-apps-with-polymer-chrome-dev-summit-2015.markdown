With the combination of Web Components and Service worker, web developers have incredibly powerful and fundamentally new tools to build applications. We’ll explain how we on the Polymer team see these two technologies creating a whole new paradigm for building applications on the web, and how Polymer can help make it easier to build this brand-new breed of web application.

Rob Dodson is a developer advocate at Google where he focuses on Polymer and Web Components. In previous roles he’s helped craft design systems for massive enterprise companies, user interfaces for console titles, and even built the occasional enchanted princess game. These days his mission is to fight for a better web and to help developers build great experiences.
