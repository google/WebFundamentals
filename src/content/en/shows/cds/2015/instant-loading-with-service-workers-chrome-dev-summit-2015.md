Service workers can power your web app while offline, but they can also offer substantial performance benefits while online. We’ll explain how to structure your web app to optimize load time for initial and return visitors, and cover helpful service worker libraries that minimize the amount of boilerplate code you’ll have to write.

Jeff is a member of the Open Web Platform Developer Relations team at Google. Amongst other activities, he helps write libraries that take the ""work"" out of service workers.
