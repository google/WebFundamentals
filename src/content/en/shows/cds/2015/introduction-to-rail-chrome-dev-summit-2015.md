Looking around at web performance advice today can be overwhelming: everything comes with caveats, disclaimers, and sometimes one piece of advice can seem to actively contradict another. Phrases like “the DOM is slow” or “always use CSS animations!” make for great headlines, but the truth is often far more nuanced. In this session we'll look at how to think holistically about performance, and how to prioritize optimization work that your users will notice and appreciate.

Paul Irish is a front-end developer who loves the web. He works on Google Chrome, its performance and DevTools.

Paul Lewis is a Developer Advocate at Google. He spends his time trying to figure out patterns for making the next generation of web apps beautiful, integrated, useful, and performant. He tries lots of things in the process, which is why he looks like a crash test dummy.
