# Who is responsible for design? {: .page-title }

Welcome to _Designer Vs Developer_, a show that tries to solve the challenges
faced in the industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing
take aways, solutions to workflows, tools and discussions on everyday struggles.

This week Mustafa speaks to Sérgio Gomes, a Developer 
Programs Engineer on the Google Developer Relations Team, 
about the responsibility for design and why developers 
don’t take that leap to become designers once and for all.
