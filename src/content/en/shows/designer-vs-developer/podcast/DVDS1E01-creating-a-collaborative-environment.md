# Creating a collaborative environment {: .page-title }

Welcome to Designer Vs Developer, a show that tries to solve the challenges
faced in industry by having an open conversation between the two, providing 
take aways, solutions to workflows, tools & discussions on everyday struggles. 

This week we speak to Jake Archibald about communication and the assumption
that designers and developers sole role is to either make things look pretty
or to be a cog in a machine with no soul.
