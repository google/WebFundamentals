# Balancing creativity with user testing {: .page-title }

Welcome to Designer Vs Developer, a show that tries to solve the challenges

This week Mustafa speaks to Ewa Gasperowicz, Front End Developer on the Google
Developer Relations Team, about whether the UX movement has over regulated the
creative process and how we can bring back that sparkle into a project by
making sandwiches.
