# Adopting the native language of the web {: .page-title }

Welcome to _Designer Vs Developer_, a show that tries to solve the challenges
faced in the industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing
take aways, solutions to workflows, tools and discussions on everyday struggles.

This week Mustafa speaks to Ade Oshineye, a Developer Advocate on the Google
Developer Relations Team, about how the incorrect use of design language has
influenced us to adopt the UX practices of the native app world and how the web
should seek to create a native language of its own.
