faced in the industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing
take aways, solutions to workflows, tools and discussions on everyday struggles.

Developer Relations Team, about whether the design tools we use are fit for
purpose and how Dash Elements (now renamed to ‘

HowTo: Components</a>’) will help educate designers and developers about
important topics like accessibility.
