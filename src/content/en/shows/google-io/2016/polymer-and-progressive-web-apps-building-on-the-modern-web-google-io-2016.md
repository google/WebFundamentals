Taylor Savage on Polymer and Progressive Web Apps: Building on the modern web

The Polymer library, re-written from the ground up with its 1.0 release last year, helps you build composable, interoperable components to use in your web applications. We'll go over the latest features of the library, show how to use some powerful newly-released components, show how Polymer is used in practice, dive into the cutting-edge tools for shipping component-based applications, reveal a brand-new way to get started building Progressive Web Applications with Polymer, and a take sneak peek into the future of the project.
