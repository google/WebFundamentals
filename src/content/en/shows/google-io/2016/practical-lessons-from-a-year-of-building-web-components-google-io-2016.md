Web components are the new shiny thing on the web, but what makes a good web component? How do you design a useful API that works for all of your users and all of their browsers? How do you make it render quickly and how do you teach people how to use it? After a year of working on the Polymer Elements, I've made sure to make all the possible mistakes so that you don't have to. This talk is about the things I've learned from that.
