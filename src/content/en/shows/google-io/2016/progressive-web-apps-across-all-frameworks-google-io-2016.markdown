Addy Osmani on Progressive Web Apps across all frameworks.

Progressive Web Apps can be built using any JavaScript library or framework, whether it's React, Angular 2.0, Ember or Polymer. In this talk, we'll dive into how to craft offline, lightning fast web apps using these solutions. Learn how to take advantage of Service Workers, Server-side Rendering and an application "shell" architecture to optimize for first meaningful paint, fast-first load and repeat visits.
