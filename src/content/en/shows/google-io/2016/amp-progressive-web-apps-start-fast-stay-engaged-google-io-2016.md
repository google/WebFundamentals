Alex Russell on AMP + Progressive Web Apps: Start fast, stay engaged. 

AMP delivers outstanding page-load performance for users browsing content on the mobile web, which is hugely important on limited or flaky networks. AMP gets content in front of users fast.

Progressive Web Apps deliver reliable performance for re-visits to sites thanks to Service Workers and the App Shell architecture. This technique allows sites to deliver rich experiences without worrying about networks.

Until now, however, these approaches for accelerating the mobile web have appeared to be in conflict. What if it were possible to use them in conjunction to deliver fast initial loading and reliable second-visit performance, as well as advanced features like offline reading and richer UI treatment?

Come learn about how to make AMP-based PWAs and hear about how this architecture is working for real-world publishers today.
