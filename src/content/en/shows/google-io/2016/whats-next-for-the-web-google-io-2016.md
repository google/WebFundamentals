Chris Wilson and Francois Beaufort on What's next for the web?

This talk focuses on the leading edge of web APIs - covering little-known, high-impact features we've recently shipped like Fetch and Web MIDI enabling new markets to use the web, and features that are being experimented with now, like Streams, foreign fetch, IntersectionObserver, Web Bluetooth controlling robots, lightbulbs and Physical Web beacons, and WebUSB for Arduino devices and more.  We will also spend some time describing the experimental framework that enables us to try out new features with broad markets while ensuring we don't burn in proprietary APIs.
