Does the “Forgot password” link on your site receive more clicks than you'd like? Creating, remembering and typing passwords is a real hassle for users, especially on mobile screens. As a result, users get stuck on the sign-in screen and have established a habit to reuse the same passwords across different sites, which of course entails a significant security risk. 

Learn about best practices on how to make your auth system more convenient and secure for your users - from the bare minimum (e.g., form annotation), to the more advanced (e.g., making your users immune to phishing).
