People use Google millions of times per day on their mobile phones. As a primary gateway to discover and engage, you'll learn how Search is evolving well beyond ten blue links to bring your content to people in much richer and faster ways. We'll discuss how you can surface fresher and more real-time content, introduce new treatments for engaging and content-forward discovery experiences, and we'll let you know how the open source Accelerated Mobile Pages project (AMP) can provide blazing fast reading experiences for all the amazing content that you build.
