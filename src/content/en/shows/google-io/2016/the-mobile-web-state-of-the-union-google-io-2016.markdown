The web platform is important. It's an open, interoperable platform for developers to build experiences that can be accessed by a large potential audience with no friction. But the shift to mobile hasn't been easy. Chrome, in partnership with members of the broader web browser community, have been hard at work transitioning the web platform to work well on mobile devices and the mobile web is open for business. This talk will provide an overview of the changes to the web platform, including Accelerated Mobile Pages and Progressive Web Apps, and what it means for you.
