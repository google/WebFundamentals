Scott Jenson introduces the Physical Web. The Physical Web is an extension of the web into the physical world so you can walk up and interact with any device, from a lost dog collar to a zipCar, all without installing an application first. Every smart device links to a web page so things can offer simple information, like a phone number, or more complex interactions like unlocking a car door. With the Physical Web, your phone or tablet can find the things around you and let you interact with whatever youâ€™re interested in.
