This talk focuses on some interesting new interaction patterns progressive web apps bring along, and explores the role they can play in emerging markets, where Opera has a large part of its user base. It also explores some remaining issues and missing parts that we need to fix to make progressive web apps work even better, and if everything goes right, even show a demo or two.

Andreas works for Opera Software, where he is product manager of Opera for Android and Dev Relations team lead. Over the last year, he’s been working on getting Opera to support the technology stack powering progressive web apps — successfully so! —, and he’s been talking about them at various developer events. Previously, he was PM for browser extensions, web evangelist, and product tester at Opera.
