Sarah Clark from Google's Web training team, shares how Udacity is partnering with Google Developers to educate Progressive Web App developers at scale.

On day 1 of the Progressive Web Applications Summit, Sarah's team announced two new courses and a new credential from Udacity.

The Progressive Web Applications Specialization is an additional credential on top of the Sr. Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree. If you're interested in this credential, please sign up to be notified when it opens for the first cohort of students: https://goo.gl/pGWnvW

We released two courses building on the talks at the summit, including the first course in the specialization. All of Udacity's courses are available for free; if you want additional coaching and/or a formal credential, you can enroll in the paid Nanodegree program.

Client-Server Communications is a deep dive into HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. It also dives into securing your code against common attacks: https://goo.gl/7rHPT1

Web Accessibility is a comprehensive course that will make you an accessibility expert. You'll learn how to design for accessibility, assess the accessibility of existing sites, and repair accessibility issues: https://goo.gl/12jJJ9

Also keep your eyes open for Web Push, the second course in the specialization, coming soon!
