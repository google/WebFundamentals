Web components provide a standard way to create reusable components on the web. In this talk, we'll discuss how to leverage these new features to build PWA, introduce the idea of "progressively enhanced markup", and cover all the changes happening in Custom Elements and Shadow DOM API v1. Both landing in browsers later this year.
