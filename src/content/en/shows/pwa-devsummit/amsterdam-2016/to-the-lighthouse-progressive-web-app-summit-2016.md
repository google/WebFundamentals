How do you put the "progressive" into your current web app? Starting with an existing codebase, we'll step through changes any developer can make to incrementally improve their web app, with a focus on passing the tests provided by the Lighthouse tool. We'll end up with a web app that takes full advantage of the platform's capabilities, whatever platform it happens to be running on.
