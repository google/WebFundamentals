Designing for mixed-endpoint topologies: from connecting WebRTC to SIP or phone endpoints, to designing for hybrid mesh/SFU topologies or working across both ORTC and WebRTC until the standards align, Rob from Twilio will talk through design approach, frustrations and lessons learned in building a signaling framework and client SDKs to support it all.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
