Skedans provides real time collaboration between drones, operators and sensors using WebRTC. With the growing use of drones for business, Skedans gives developers the means to easily manage and coordinate the growing array of video streams, sensor feeds, and operators used in critical drone applications.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
