<img src="/web/shows/http203/podcast/images/io.jpg" class="attempt-right">

In this episode we chat to [Martin Splitt](https://twitter.com/g33konaut), who works on the Google
search team. We cover stuff like:

* Onesies.
* Blowing up a snowman.
* How Jake set fire to the office on his first day.
* Making search play well with JavaScript.
* How to see [what your site looks like to Google
  search](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch).
* Search's [mobile first testing tool](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).

Martin didn't give a talk at I/O this search, but check out the talk by the search team, [Building a
successful web presence with Google Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO-sdBzb1Hc).
