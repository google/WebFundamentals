<img src="/web/shows/http203/podcast/images/io-mariko.jpg" class="attempt-right">

In this episode we chat to [Mariko Kosaka](https://twitter.com/kosamari), another of our fellow
Chrome dev-rels. We cover:

* Turns out we've been pronouncing "Surma" and "Mariko" all wrong.
* The woes of color spaces.
* [Getting image compressors working on the web using
  WASM](/web/updates/2018/03/emscripting-a-c-library).
* How we got started, and why we chose the web.
* Creating awful HTML in Microsoft Word.
* AIM vs Microsoft Comic Chat.
* And Mariko buys Jake a birthday present.
