# I/O chat with Darin Fisher {: .page-title }

<img src="/web/shows/http203/podcast/images/io.jpg" class="attempt-right">

In this episode we chat to [Ewa Gasperowicz](https://twitter.com/devnook), another of our fellow
Chrome dev-rels. We cover:

* Getting web performance right.
* Getting performance tests into [Lighthouse](/web/tools/lighthouse/).
* Does a "functionality first" approach mean performance is forgotten about?
* How it's no longer possible to know all browser technologies.

Also check out Ewa and Addy's I/O talk, [web performance made
easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk).
