In this episode we chat to [Sathya Gunasekaran](https://twitter.com/_gsathya) and [Mathias
Bynens](https://twitter.com/mathias), who work on the V8 JavaScript team. We cover stuff like:

* Pronouncing names.
* Modules vs classic scripts.
* `let` & `const` scoping.
* Class fields, as in private properties.
* Dynamic imports.
* Modules in workers.
* How V8 dealt with Meltdown and Spectre.
* Pipeline vs bind.

Also check out their I/O talk, [Building the future of the web with modern
JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWCLOftfRw)
