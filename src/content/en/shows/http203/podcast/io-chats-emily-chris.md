In this episode we chat to [Emily Schechter](https://twitter.com/emschec) and [Chris
Palmer](https://twitter.com/fugueish), who work on the security team for Chrome. We cover stuff
like:

* What Meltdown and Spectre are, and why they're a problem.
* How annoying it is when someone conducts a sound test while you're trying to record a podcast.
* [Cross-origin read blocking](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#corb).
* [Samesite cookies](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02#section-5.3.7).
* Getting the long tail of the web onto HTTPS.
* Updating Chrome's UI to indicate HTTP is "not secure".

Also check out Emily and Chris's I/O talk, [Palmer and Schechter on Meltdown and
Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBuykrdhK-A).
