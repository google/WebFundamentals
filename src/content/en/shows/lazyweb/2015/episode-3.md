## In this week's episode

Chrome 42 lands with Push notifications, Jacob Kaplan-Moss debunks myths about programmers, protocol relative URLs are now anti-patterns, the mobile friendly badge hits Google, git tips with First Aid Git, and optimizing your app with RAIL.

### CHROME 42 IS HERE

Chrome 42 hit stable this week and with it comes a number of new features. Push notifications let users opt-in to timely updates, install banners prompt users to save pages to their home screen, permissions let you know if you can use an API, fetch acts as a replacement for XHR, and it even includes support for ES6 classes.

### MYTH BUSTER

Jacob Kaplan-Moss keynote from this year’s PyCon breaks down the dichotomy that developers are either 10x badasses or completely terrible. Removing these assumptions helps us better address problems like imposter syndrome and work to improve potentially toxic work environments.

### TLS ALL THE THINGS!

Protocol relative URLs are now an anti-pattern. Tweeted by Paul Irish this week, the practice of leaving off the protocol from a URL is now discouraged as it can possibly lead to Man-on-the-side attacks, similar to the one that hit GitHub. The new recommendation is to always request an asset over https if it is available on SSL.

### R U MOBILE FRIENDLY?

Check to see if your site is mobile friendly. A recent article on the Google Webmasters blog indicates that starting immediately, Google Search will add labels next to sites that it considers mobile friendly. The criteria includes such things as making sure that users don’t have to zoom to read the page, and links are spaced far enough apart. You can use the mobile friendly test to ensure your site meets the bar. And skill up at Web Fundamentals.
