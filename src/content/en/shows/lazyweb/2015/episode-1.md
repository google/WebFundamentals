### React Native <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">0:13</span>

React Native is an open source framework which allows you to run your react app on native iOS.
It comes with a bundle of components and you can grab additional add-ons at <a href="http://react.parts/native-ios">react.parts/native-ios</a>.

### A11y-Wins <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">0:31</span>

It's hard to find good examples of accessibility websites. To help solve this problem
Marcy Sutton has created <a href="http://a11ywins.tumblr.com/">a11ywins.tumblr.com</a>
which covers sites which are doing accessibility right.

Learn more on accessibility by <a href="https://vimeo.com/118697675">watching Marcy Sutton's talk from Smashing Conf</a>.

### Preload Links <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">1:05</span>

Downloading resources can be a major bottleneck and preload links are a new way to give the browser prioritization over what assets to download ahead of time.

With this <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/Abrd-tbDyuQ/4YP6_yvBa94J">intent to implement</a>, signals are good that it'll be coming to Chrome.

### Project Spartan <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">1:21</span>

Project Spartan is Microsoft's new browser built to be lean, mean and standards compliant. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/31/8319169/project-spartan-new-browser-microsoft-hands-on">The Verge</a> took for a test drive and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKjkfkAmzAg">learn more from either</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A5ZXWTIlHw">these videos from Microsoft</a>.

### Physical Web Beacons <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">1:42</span>

The <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">Physical Web</a> was a project started at Google which uses
beacons to transmit signals which are picked up by mobile devices to know what is around them.

Blesh have just released a demo of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AryiXsPQ1Y">their physical web beacons which you can watch here</a>.
