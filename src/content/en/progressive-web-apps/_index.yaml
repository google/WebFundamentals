          Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of
          the web, and are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Reliable</b> - Load instantly and never show the downasaur,
            even in uncertain network conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fast</b> - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky
            smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Engaging</b> - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an
            immersive user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a
          place on the user's home screen.

      description: >
        <p>
          When launched from the user’s home screen, service workers enable a
          Progressive Web App to load instantly, regardless of the network
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          A service worker, written in JavaScript, is like a client-side proxy
          and puts you in control of the cache and how to respond to resource
          requests. By pre-caching key resources you can eliminate the
          dependence on the network, ensuring an instant and reliable
          experience for your users.

        53% of users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to
        load! And once loaded, users expect them to be fast—no janky scrolling
        or slow-to-respond interfaces.

          Progressive Web Apps are installable and live on the user's
          <b>home screen</b>, without the need for an app store. They
          offer an <b>immersive full screen</b> experience with help from a
          web app manifest file and can even re-engage users with web
          <b>push notifications</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web App Manifest allows you to control how your app appears and
          how it's launched. You can specify home screen icons, the page to load
          when the app is launched, screen orientation, and even whether or not
          to show the browser chrome.

          Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the

          manual testing that was previously required. You can even use
          Lighthouse in continuous integration systems to catch regressions.
