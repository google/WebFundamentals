# Progressive Web App Checklist {: .page-title }

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are reliable, fast, and engaging, although there are 
many things that can take a PWA from a baseline to exemplary experience.

To help teams create the best possible experiences we've put together this 
checklist which breaks down all the things we think it takes to be a
[Baseline](#baseline) PWA, and how to take that a step further with an
[Exemplary](#exemplary) PWA by providing a more meaningful offline experience,
reaching interactive even faster and taking care of many more important details.

            You can understand your performance better by using 
            <a href="/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Pagespeed Insights</a>
            (aim for a score &gt;85) and <b>SpeedIndex</b> on
            <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org">WebPageTest</a>

            A few tips are to focus on loading less script, make sure as much 
            script is loaded asynchronously as possible using <code>&lt;script
            async&gt;</code> and make sure
            <a href="/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css">
            render blocking CSS</a> is marked as such.

notifications is not a requirement for an exemplary progressive web app.

            that context has been provided explaining what the site wants 
            the permission for.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the site is requesting for the permission on page load, ensure it 
            provides very clear context simultaneously for why the user should 
            enable push notifications.
