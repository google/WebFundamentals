Memory loss occurs when a program repeatedly fails to return memory it has obtained for temporary use. Watch out for memory leaks, bloat, and forced garbage collection.

The JavaScript engines of today are highly capable of automatically cleaning garbage
generated by our code in a number of situations.
That said, they can only go so far and
our applications are still prone to memory leaks caused by logical errors.
Use the tools available to find out your bottlenecks and remember, don't guess it - test it.
